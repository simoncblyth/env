BitBucket Issue Import/Export Data Format : a json file with attachments directory.
JSON format documented  

* https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=330796872

When using the issue tracker import/export feature to move issues from one
Bitbucket repo to another, the issue IDs remain the same. However, the comment
IDs and therefore the permlinks, change. Comment IDs change because, in
contrast to issue IDs, they are not local to the repo. 

Certain objects, such as comments, rely on foreign keys.  During an import,
Bitbucket silently uses NULL to replace any foreign keys that it cannot resolve
(for example, a username that no longer exists on Bitbucket).



Problems
-----------

#. initially the trac2bitbucket export got all times wrong due to 
   a trac version specific factor of 1 million in timestamps 

   Manually fixed this in working copy.

Questions
-----------

#. what to do about usernames ?

   * at least maqm, lint need to be operative
