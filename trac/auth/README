This folder contains pieces of Trac extracted to 
allow sharing Trac/SVN users with other applications such as
   * django
   * ejabberd

These works were extracted from Trac svn at revision 9923 with :
{{{
svn export http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/trunk/trac/web/auth.py
svn export http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/trunk/COPYING
}}}

Actually no ... ensure consistency by using the Trac 0.11 ones from the .egg :
{{{
cp $(python-site)/Trac-0.11-py2.5.egg/trac/util/__init__.py util.py
cp $(python-site)/Trac-0.11-py2.5.egg/trac/web/auth.py     auth.py
}}}

They were modified to retain the functionality of 
   * BasicAuthentication
   * DigestAuthentication    (untested)

== checking username/password pairs ==

Usage example :
{{{
from env.trac.auth import BasicAuthentication 
ba = BasicAuthentication("users-htpasswd-file.txt")
ba.test('username','password')
}}}

== updating the users file ==

{{{
svn export http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/trunk/contrib/htpasswd.py 
}}}


== TODO ==
 
   * integrate functionality of htpasswd.py with BasicAuthentication
       * maybe : AccountManagerPlugin has done this already ?

   * use the merged class to create ejabberd and django external authenticators
