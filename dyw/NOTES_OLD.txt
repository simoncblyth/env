#    Notes :
#    ========
#
#   I have succeeded to install and run G4dyb on pal with
#   the OIX open inventor G4 graphics driver
#   (5 working days this time !)
#
#   I couldnt get the openmotif or coin3d widgets to be visible
#   remotely, but they seemed to all build and install fine so
#   I think that it will work (you will need to make changes
#   to  the main : G4dyb/app/dyw.cc  to check these , I've attached
#   my dyw.cc to this mail)
#
#   The prerequisites are installed in /usr/local  (moving to $LOCAL_BASE)
#

#   The  commands that I used to download, configure ,
#   build, install and setup the environment of all these packages
#   can be found in :
#         /home/sblyth/.bash_*
#  .bash_profile sources all these sub scripts
#  .bash_dayabay is special, defining more functions :
#
#
#  For example .bash_clhep defines bash functions :
#         clhep-get
#         clhep-configure
#         clhep-build
#   as well as sets the needed environment.
#
#   In particular it sets "my" _CMT variable :
#         export CLHEP_CMT="CLHEP_config:$CLHEP_FOLDER/bin/clhep-config"
#
#    which is used in .bash_dayabay to construct  DYW_CMT  
#         export DYW_CMT="$BOOST_CMT $CERNLIB_CMT $CLHEP_CMT $GEANT_CMT $ROOT_CMT $XERCESC_CMT $VGM_CMT"
#
#    which is then used to create the requirements.$LOCAL_NODE file by my function
#    dyw-requirements   (defined in .bash_dayabay)
#
#
# I suggest you :
#
#     have a look at .bash_dayabay and then run :
#
#         dyw-get                 ## does CVS login and initial checkout
#
#         dyw-requirements        ##  constructs the requirements.$LOCAL_NODE file
#         dyw-init
#         dyw-build
#   
#        g4dyb             ## run G4dyb.exe
#
#
#   It might also be a good idea to build and try the Geant4 examples
#  (functions defined in .bash_geant4_use )
#
#       geant4-copy-examples
#       _a01     ## builds example extended/analysis/A01
#       a01      ## runs
