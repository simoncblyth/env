PIFI Progress Report August 2018
===================================


::

   Explain why priorities reordered:

   1. ease of usage 
   2. validation  


Prior to starting my PIFI work at IHEP in May 
I received several requests from users for simple 
examples demonstrating Opticks usage. Thinking about 
how to do this made be realise that the Opticks 
workflow and architecture was focussed 
on the needs of development rather than the needs of users. 
This realisation together with my goal of enabling anyone 
to apply Opticks GPU acceleration to their simulation has 
led me to focus during the first months of my PIFI work
on making the major architectural changes necessary to 
achieve this vision.
  

::

    As a result of this the work of 
    the first three months at IHEP has been aimed at 
    making Opticks acceleration straightforward to 
    use by any Geant4 user.

     
    and the aim t be able to use Opticks with 


     comnmtribute to  
    made be shift priorities putting ease of use  

    Aspects that were inconvenient:

    * separate 
    * geometry export to G4DAE+GDML
    * project had outgrown the basic CMake configuration 
      approach used 


    for the setup of simple examples
    in a way that anyone 


    geared towards a fixed geometry with infrequnt 
    exports of detector geometry via G4DAE + GDML.

       Requests from Opticks users for examples together
       with the aim of including an example within the Geant4 distribution, 
       made me evaluate Opticks from a users perspective.
