Chroma Server
==============

* https://github.com/mastbaum/chroma-server

This package lets you run a chroma server, which performs GPU-accelerated
photon propagation for clients. Clients send chroma-server a list of initial
photon vertices, and it replies with the final vertices of detected photons.
