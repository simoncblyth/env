Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation by 
integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via NVIDIA OptiX, with 
Geant4 toolkit based simulations. 
A single NVIDIA Turing architecture GPU has been measured to provide optical 
photon simulation speedup factors exceeding 1500 times single threaded Geant4 
with a full JUNO analytic GPU geometry automatically translated from the Geant4 geometry.

Optical physics processes of scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission and 
boundary processes are implemented within CUDA OptiX programs based on the Geant4
implementations. Wavelength-dependent material and surface properties as well as  
inverse cumulative distribution functions for reemission are interleaved into 
GPU textures providing fast interpolated property lookup or wavelength generation.

Major recent developments are the integration of Opticks with the JUNO simulation 
framework using a minimal G4Opticks interface class. Also enhancements 
that greatly reduce CPU memory for hits with GPU efficiency culling 
and prepare for migration to NVIDIA OptiX 7 are presented.
