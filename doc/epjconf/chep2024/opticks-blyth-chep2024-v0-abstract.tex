Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation 
by integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via the NVIDIA OptiX API, with
Geant4 toolkit based simulations.
Optical photon simulation times of 10 seconds per 100 million photons
with the full JUNO geometry and optical model have been measured 
with a 3rd generation RTX GPU. The JUNO optical model incorporates 
optical processes inside PMTs including thin layer interference effects. 
The GPU geometry is auto-translated from the Geant4 geometry 
Optical physics processes of scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission 
and boundary processes are implemented in CUDA based on Geant4.  
Wavelength-dependent material and surface
properties as well as inverse cumulative distribution functions for reemission
are interleaved into GPU textures providing fast interpolated property lookup
or wavelength generation. 
In this work we describe performance measurements and new features developed 
to facilitate and optimize production usage of Opticks within the JUNO simulation framework. 
The features include geometry generalization enabling use of triangulated solids 
together with analytic geometry, out-of-core processing enabling simulation of 
events with more photons than can fit within available VRAM and also the adoption
of the Philox counter-based random number generator optimizing random number generation.
