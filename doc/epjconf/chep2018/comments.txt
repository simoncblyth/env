Referee 1:

This paper presents an interesting topic for optical photon simulations and geometry modeling relevant to high energy physics. The paper is already in good shape, only requiring a few minor edits suggested below.

*** Abstract:
Wavelength dependent => Wavelength-dependent

*** Introduction:
Multiple references at once are usually [1,2], [3-5], [6-8]. However, in cases where the references have a lot in common, such as with 3-5, it can be better to group these all into one reference number, with the three parts separated by semicolons. This is probably the case for all of these: 1 & 2 can be a single reference for Opticks, and 6-8 can be contained in a single reference for OptiX.
Geant4 based => Geant4-based (also in the summary)
The prior => Prior

*** Sect. 1.1
The title of this section seems out of place. What you want to focus on is the importance of the optical photon simulation to the physics, not the importance of muons (i.e. the photons are important because of the muons).
Geant4 toolkit based => Geant4-toolkit-based

*** Sect. 2.3
two stage => two-stage
because is not => because it is not
reconstructed it a => reconstructed in a
one to one => one-to-one

*** Sect 3
A single class G4Opticks is => A single class, G4Opticks, is

*** Sect 4
near perfectly => nearly perfectly

*** Fig. 2 caption
geometry, effects => geometry. Effects
or...  geometry; effects

*** Bibliography
Reference 13: Pages => pp
