Thank you for the comments.  I have acted upon them all. Only the grouping 
of references turned out to be not straightforward : so I went with the 
simple first approach you suggested.


> *** Abstract:
> Wavelength dependent => Wavelength-dependent

OK

Manual grouping separated by semicolons leads to the references being difficult to read. 
So I attemped to use bibtex and mcite grouping capabilities. 
But those turn out not to work well with the woc.bst provided (and mandated) by epjconf.

Thus as the benefits of grouped references are minor, I decided the clearest 
and simplest approach was to go with the suggestion of your first sentence.

> Geant4 based => Geant4-based (also in the summary)
OK (OK)

> The prior => Prior
OK

> *** Sect. 1.1
> The title of this section seems out of place. What you want to focus on is the
> importance of the optical photon simulation to the physics, not the importance
> of muons (i.e. the photons are important because of the muons).

Good catch : I went with "Importance of Optical Photon Simulation to Neutrino Detectors"

> Geant4 toolkit based => Geant4-toolkit-based
OK

> *** Sect. 2.3
> two stage => two-stage
OK

> because is not => because it is not
OK

> reconstructed it a => reconstructed in a
OK

> one to one => one-to-one
OK

> *** Sect 3
> A single class G4Opticks is => A single class, G4Opticks, is
OK

> *** Sect 4
> near perfectly => nearly perfectly
OK

> *** Fig. 2 caption
> geometry, effects => geometry. Effects   or...  geometry; effects
OK

> *** Bibliography
> Reference 13: Pages => pp
OK
