\begin{abstract}
Opticks is an open source project that integrates the NVIDIA OptiX 
GPU ray tracing engine with Geant4 toolkit based simulations.
Massive parallelism brings drastic performance improvements with  
optical photon simulation speedup expected to exceed 1000 times Geant4 
when using workstation GPUs. Optical photon simulation time becomes 
effectively zero compared to the rest of the simulation.
Optical photons from scintillation and Cherenkov processes
are allocated, generated and propagated entirely on the GPU, minimizing 
transfer overheads and allowing CPU memory usage to be restricted to
optical photons that hit photomultiplier tubes or other photon detectors.
Collecting hits into standard Geant4 hit collections then allows the 
rest of the simulation chain to proceed unmodified.
Optical physics processes of scattering, absorption, reemission and 
boundary processes are implemented as CUDA OptiX programs based on the Geant4
implementations. Wavelength dependent material and surface properties as well as  
inverse cumulative distribution functions for reemission are interleaved into 
GPU textures providing fast interpolated property lookup or wavelength generation.
Geometry is provided to OptiX in the form of CUDA programs that return bounding boxes 
for each primitive and single ray geometry intersection results. Some critical parts 
of the geometry such as photomultiplier tubes have been implemented analytically 
with the remainder being tesselated. 
OptiX handles the creation and application of a choice of acceleration structures
such as boundary volume heirarchies and the transparent use of multiple GPUs. 
OptiX supports interoperation with OpenGL and CUDA Thrust that has enabled 
unprecedented visualisations of photon propagations to be developed 
using OpenGL geometry shaders to provide interactive time scrubbing and    
CUDA Thrust photon indexing to provide interactive history selection. 
Validation and performance results are shown for the photomultiplier based 
Daya Bay and JUNO Neutrino detectors.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Chroma}

The Chroma project\cite{chromaURL}\cite{chromaB}  
implements both GPU ray tracing and optical photon simulation using CUDA kernels
that are launched via PyCUDA scripts. 
%A message queue server is provided 
%to facilitate use of Chroma functionality from C++ code.
The development of Opticks was made possible by  
the experience I gained from working with Chroma.

Ray tracing performance comparisons between NVIDIA OptiX and a 
fork of Chroma\cite{chromaFork} halted my work with Chroma.
In addition to performance other limitations of Chroma include:
lack of validation comparisons against Geant4, no support for multiple GPUs, 
memory inefficient photon handling requiring the copying of photons from CPU to GPU,
memory inefficient geometry handling due to lack of geometry instancing, python 
implementation makes integration with Geant4 and other C++ code inconvenient. 

\subsection{VecGeom and GeantV}

%http://geant.cern.ch/content/publications

The GeantV\cite{GeantV} (Geant-Vector) project aims 
to develop an all-particle transport simulation package that is 
several times faster than Geant4. The principal approach investigated 
is the application of SIMD operations across vectors of multiple tracks 
collected from multiple events according to locality criteria, this necessitates 
the development of vectorised geometry algorithms.  
The VecGeom\cite{VecGeom} project aims to provide these algorithms and also 
to optimize the single particle scalar performance.
VecGeom also includes CUDA implementations of the geometry algorithms.
%
Currently Opticks implements its own CUDA/OptiX geometry algorithms
for the small number of solids required to provide an analytic description 
of Photomultiplier tubes. 
Adoption of VecGeom within Opticks is a possible future development.

%Intel\textregistered\ Xeon Phi\textrademark\ coprocessors.

\subsection{JUNO Fast Simulation}

The implementation of a fast simulation of the JUNO central detector has 
been studied in\cite{junoFastSim} using the voxel method. The core
of the method is to build the connection between the visible energy
in a voxel and the response of the photomultiplier tubes.
Essentially the approach persists parameterized response distributions 
of scintillation photons obtained from a full Geant4 simulation which 
can be then sampled to form an approximation of the full simulation.
Cerenkov photon anisotropy prevents application of this approach.
The symmetry of the detector geometry greatly reduces the number of 
response distributions that need to be persisted. Details such as 
shadowing from support struts or other things that break the symmetry 
require increases in numbers of parameter binning.  

Fast simulation techniques do not provide an alternative to full simulation, 
they merely provide an approximation of the full simulation which trade 
simulation time with file input/output time and bookkeeping.

\section{Introduction}

Opticks\cite{opticksURL} is an open source software package 
that aims to solve the problem of optical photon simulation described below.
Opticks works together with the Geant4\cite{g4A}\cite{g4B}\cite{g4C} toolkit, 
replacing only the optical photon simulation with an 
equivalent optical simulation implemented on the GPU and accelerated 
by the NVIDIA OptiX\cite{optixSite}\cite{optixPaper} ray tracing engine.

\subsection{Optical Photon Simulation Problem}

%A detailed understanding of the generation and propagation of optical 
%photons is vital to the design, operation and analysis of photomultiplier
%based neutrino detectors such as the Daya Bay~\cite{dyb} and JUNO\cite{juno} experiments. 

Cosmic muon induced processes are crucial backgrounds for neutrino
detectors such as Daya Bay~\cite{dyb} and JUNO\cite{juno}, 
necessitating the use of muon veto systems.
Minimizing the dead time and dead volume that results from applying 
a veto requires an understanding of the detector response to the muon.
Large simulated samples of muon events are crucial in order to 
develop such an understanding and also to provide efficiency estimates 
that are critical inputs to physics analyses.

The number of optical photons estimated to be produced by a muon of 
typical energy crossing the Daya Bay detector is at the level of several millions, 
for JUNO the estimate is an order of magnitude larger. 
Profiling the Geant4 based Daya Bay simulation 
shows the propagation of optical photons to consume more than 95\% of CPU time. 
In addition to the CPU time the memory requirements for handling many millions 
of photons pose severe constraints.  

%A fundamental requirement of optical photon propagation is to compute 
%the next boundary intersection of a ray in the direction of travel 
%at each step of the propagation in a highly efficient manner.

%Geant4 uses a solid based geometry model with volumes of particular shape and material, 
%such as cylinders of acrylic, GdLS or water. These volumes form a tree of mother volumes 
%containing non-intersecting daughter volumes which in turn contain their own daughters, and so on. 
%The tree structure and containment condition limits the number of volumes which 
%must be be interrogated in order to compute the next boundary intersection, as if the 
%mother of a volume does not intersect then its daughters cannot.


\subsection{Solution : Geant4 + Opticks}

As optical photons in neutrino detectors can be considered to be produced 
by only the scintillation and Cerenkov processes and yield only hits 
on photomultiplier tubes it is straightforward to integrate an
external optical photon simulation with a Geant4 simulation of all other particles.
%
The uncoupled, highly parallel and rather simple nature of the optical physics 
that is sufficient to describe neutrino detectors makes optical photon propagation 
well suited to general purpose GPU computing techniques where
high performance requires massive parallelism with minimal communication between threads
and low register usage.  

The most computationally intensive aspect of optical photon simulation
is the determination, at each step of the propagation, of the intersection point 
of rays representing photon directions with the geometry of the detector. This 
makes sense as the large data structures that model the geometry contrast
markedly with the simple structures used to model the optical physics.


\subsection{Image Synthesis parallels to Optical Photon Simulation} 

The synthesis of realistic images from models of geometry, 
light sources and optical physics has many applications in 
the advertising, design, film and games industries. 
Image synthesis is closely related to optical photon simulation, 
and crucially is limited by the same thing, namely the 
computation of intersections between rays and geometry.  

Ray tracing is a well studied problem in computing due to its many commercial 
applications. NVIDIA OptiX\cite{optixPaper}\cite{optixSite} 




\section{Geometry}


%However in order to create an external GPU simulation consistent with 
%the Geant4 simulation it is necessary to duplicate the Geant4 context on the GPU.





Optical photon propagation limited by the calculation of intersections between 
rays and geometry. 


Once intersection points and surface normals are known the remainder of the 
simulation only requires generation of a few random numbers 

Geometry intersection typically limits simulation performance. Geometry model
determines techniques (and hardware) available to accelerate intersection.

\begin{itemize}
\item Geometry model implications, 
\item G4DAE Geometry Exporter, volume tree, use extensiblity of DAE to include material/surface props as function of wavelength
\item importing Geometry, assimpfork \cite{Assimp} \cite{AssimpFork}
\item surface based geometry (BREP) more natural for ray tracing 
\item Geometry model translation, volume to surface based geometry (4 indices attached to primitives) in/out G4LogicalBorderSurface
\item mesh fixing with OpenMesh\cite{OpenMesh}
\item geocache using NumPy serialization
\item geometry instancing mandatory
\item analytic primitives for PMT, manual approach 
\item material and surface properties in GPU textures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometry Model Implications}




Geometries are defined in Geant4 by a hierarchical tree structure of volumes, each containing smaller volumes
which may not overlap. Volumes have associated solids which are modelled using 
the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) technique. This allows the use of 

boolean combination—union, intersection and subtraction. The solids should be either CSGs or other boolean solids (the product of a previous boolean opera- tion).




Volumes are associated with solids of particular geometrical shapes 

Solids with simple shapes, like rectilinear boxes, trapezoids, spherical and cylindrical sec- tions or shells, each have their properties coded separately, in accord with the concept of Con- structive Solid Geometry (CSG). 



Geant4 uses a solid based geometry model with volumes of particular shape and material,
These volumes form a tree of mother volumes
containing non-intersecting daughter volumes which in turn contain their own daughters, and so on.
The tree structure and containment condition limits the number of volumes which
must be be interrogated in order to compute the next boundary intersection, as if the
mother of a volume does not intersect then its daughters cannot.







\section{Event}

\begin{itemize}
\item cuRAND random numbers, initialization stack workaround
\item generation of scintillation and Cerenkov photons from gensteps (explain: Geant4 process "stack")
\item GPU resident photons, all operations done on GPU: seeded (assigned gensteps), generated, propagated, indexed 
\item photon indexing with CUDA Thrust 
\item integrated Geant4/Opticks workflow
\item multi-event handling 
\end{itemize}

\section{Validation}

\begin{itemize}
\item CFG4: one executable doing two simulations: pure G4 and G4+Opticks 
\item G4 step recorder in Opticks event format

\item torch light source, commandline configured 
\item fresnel, rainbow, PmtInBox, tconcentric
\item compressed recording of propagation steps
\item frequency count chi2 distance, distrib chi2
\end{itemize}

\section{Visualisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item small number of VBOs for entire geometry, one for non-instanced, one for each case of instanced geometry
\item persistent viewpoint bookmarks 
\item composited OpenGL rasterized render and OptiX ray trace, using Z-depth calulated for each raytrace pixel.
\item OptiX/OpenGL/CUDA/Thrust interoperation, same GPU buffers shared
\item OpenGL based visualization, GLFW
\item OpenGL shaders
\item time scrubbing a propagation (geometry shader with time as input)
\item index enables interactive photon history selection
\item GUI using ImGui\cite{ImGui}
\item layered dependencies, visualization on non-CUDA capable GPUs
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

\item performance comparison
\item performance factors so large they become irrelevant, its the reciprocal are interested in 
\item principal contribution : context translation (geometry, materials and surfaces) from G4 into a GPU appropriate form
      enabling optical physics simulation to benefit from state-of-the art GPU ray tracing from NVIDIA OptiX

\section{NVIDIA\textregistered OptiX\texttrademark}

\begin{itemize}
\item linearity of ray tracing performance with CUDA cores, with figure
\end{itemize}

NVIDIA\textregistered\ OptiX\texttrademark \cite{optixPaper} \cite{optixSite} 
is a general-purpose ray tracing engine designed for NVIDIA GPUs
that balances ease of use with performance by exposing a highly accessible 
single ray programming model while still remaining competitive with manually 
optimized custom approaches \cite{optixPaper} \cite{understanding}.  
The core principle of OptiX is a that ray tracing algorithms can be implemented 
from the combination of a small set of user provided programmable operations
into a ray tracing pipeline in a manner directly analogous to how OpenGL 
and Direct3D programmable shaders combine to create rasterization pipelines.
These operations are provided to OptiX in the form of CUDA programs \cite{cudaPaper} \cite{cudaURL} 
including: ray generation, object intersection and closest hit programs that operate on 
single rays. These programs together with a ray payload data structure are combined 
into a ray tracing kernel by a domain optimized Just-In-Time compiler.

Scene data is provided to OptiX via a high level node structure that 
Opticks constructs using the OptiX CPU side API. 
Geometry leaf nodes are assigned primitive counts 
and associated CUDA programs that return bounding box and 
report ray primitive intersection positions. 
The programs access GPU geometry buffers which are copied from the CPU at initialization.
Multiple geometry instance nodes are allowed to share geometry objects, this 
together with the use of transform nodes is used to model many thousands of  
photomultiplier tubes without repetition of information. This so called geometry 
instancing drastically reduces the GPU memory needed to contain the scene data.

The central data structure enabling fast ray tracing is a geometry index
known as an acceleration structure which sorts a scene’s primitives 
into spatial or object groups. 
Heirarchical tree structures are typically used
with leaves representing the primitives.  Rejection of higher level
volumes allows all contained volumes to be removed from the intersection
search. OptiX provides a simple interface to associate acceleration structures 
with different parts of a scene geometry but all the details of creation, updating 
and traversal are handled by OptiX internally using the geometrical information provided by the 
bounding box program. Opticks currently uses the SBVH structure\cite{SBVH}.
