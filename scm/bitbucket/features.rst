Argh ``scb-`` is probably not allowed as labels ending with hyphens are not valid in hostnames.

Valid Hostnames
----------------

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname

Hostnames are composed of series of labels concatenated with dots, as are all
domain names. For example, "en.wikipedia.org" is a hostname. Each label must be
between 1 and 63 characters long, and the entire hostname (including the
delimiting dots) has a maximum of 255 characters.  

The Internet standards (Request for Comments) for protocols 
mandate that component hostname labels may contain only the ASCII letters 'a' through 'z'
(in a case-insensitive manner), the digits '0' through '9', and the hyphen ('-'). 
The original specification of hostnames in RFC 952, mandated that labels could 
not start with a digit or with a hyphen, **and must not end with a hyphen**. 

However, a subsequent specification (RFC 1123) permitted hostname 
labels to start with digits. 
No other symbols, punctuation characters, or white space are permitted.
