    Dear simon blyth,

    We are contacting you as the submitter of the contribution "#45, Integration of
    JUNO simulation framework with Opticks: GPU accelerated optical propagation via
    NVIDIA OptiX" at the vCHEP’21 conference, due to be held online 17 - 21 May
    2021, https://indico.cern.ch/e/vCHEP2021 . 

    The program committee of the conference has rigorously reviewed your
    contribution and we are happy to announce that your submission has been awarded
    a presentation in a parallel session of the conference. 

    We therefore invite you to start preparing a presentation for a slot of 8
    minutes followed by a short discussion.  

    As part of the review process we will provide you a first set of comments which
    we ask you to consider for updating your paper and your presentation. The exact
    instructions on how to proceed in the peer reviewing process will be sent to
    you in the coming days. 

    Just a few more points we would ask you to please follow up:

    Please register for the conference. This is especially vital for the presenter,
    as the registration timezone of the presenter will be used to build the
    timetable. In case we cannot find the speaker timezone information by the end
    of next week we may be forced to schedule the presentation on a best guess.    

    If the presenter of the contribution has changed, will change or cannot be
    decided right now, please inform the PC chairs (chep2021-pc-chairs@cern.ch).

    Before the conference we will also contact all speakers with more preparatory
    information about the setup of the conference sessions and detailed information
    about the technical process we envisage for the session setups. 

    Looking forward to meeting you at vCHEP’21

    The PC chairs of vCHEP’21
