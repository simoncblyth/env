Dear Simon

Thank you so much. I will pencil this in for 10 March and confirm with you early in the New Year. We are also planning presentations from Andrei Gheata about the VecGeom package and how that is evolving for GPUs and from one of the LHC experiments that do reconstruction on GPUs (as tracking geometries are a bit different from simulation ones).

Best wishes

Graeme

Dear Graeme, 

Thank you for inviting me to talk on Opticks GPU geometry 
in the Compute Accelerator Forum series.

I accept the invitation. March 10th would be best for me.

Dear Simon

For a few months now we have been organising the Compute Accelerator Forum between CERN openlab, the HEP Software Foundation and CASUS  (https://www.casus.science/home-2/) to present and discuss topics on porting and performance for HEP codes on non-CPU devices. We have looked at GPU access at CERN and WLCG, abstraction techniques used in LHCb and ALICE and at the NSight tools from NVIDIA. Weâ€™re now planning the meeting series for next year:

https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/

One topic that we are keen to look at is the representation of HEP detector geometries on GPUs.

We would like to invite you to give a talk (15-20') here that describes how you solved the problem of the JUNO geometry in Opticks, particular where you were able to take advantage of GPU specialised libraries and gain maximum performance.

Would you be able to do that?

Then next open slots for the meetings would be 10 February and 10 March.

Many thanks

Graeme
