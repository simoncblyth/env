The Super-Kamiokande detector is massive, even by particle physics standards.
It consists of 50,000 tons of pure water surrounded by about 11,200
photomultiplier tubes. The detector was again designed as a cylindrical
structure, this time 41.4 m tall and 39.3 m across.

    Dear Public Affairs Dept,

    I am a Physicist working at the National Taiwan University, Taipei with the
    Daya Bay and JUNO Collaborations.

        http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/wme/PH13-bottom-yoko-1-wm.JPG

    I would like to use some of your images, such as to above, in an upcoming 
    presentation at the GPU technology conference in San Jose California.

         http://www.gputechconf.com

    My presentation is on an open source  Optical Photon Simulation 
    that I have developed using NVIDIA OptiX ray tracing framework, 
    the abstract of my talk is below.

    A technical presentation of my work is accessible below.

        http://simoncblyth.bitbucket.org/env/presentation/opticks_gpu_optical_photon_simulation_march2016.html

    To make this work accessible to a diverse audience without a background in physics
    I need to provide context and motivation for optical photon simulation.  I think that 
    introducing the audience to the use of photomultiplier tubes in several large physics 
    experiments including Super Kamiokande would be an excellent way 
    to do this, especially due to the beautiful images you have provided at
     
         http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/index-e.html

    Sincerely,
               Dr Simon C. Blyth


     
    Opticks : Optical Photon Simulation for High Energy Physics with OptiX 

    Opticks is an open source project that integrates high performance GPU 
    ray tracing from NVIDIA OptiX with existing Geant4 toolkit based simulations.
    Advantages of separate optical photon simulation and    
    the approaches developed to integrate it with the general Geant4
    particle simulation are presented. Approaches to minimize overheads
    arising from split are shown.
    Challenges included bringing complex geometries with wavelength
    dependent material and surface properties to the GPU.
    Techniques for visualisation of photon propagations with
    interactive time scrubbing and history selection using OpenGL/OptiX/Thrust
    interoperation and geometry shaders are described.
    Results and demonstrations are shown for the photomultiplier based 
    Daya Bay and JUNO Neutrino detectors. 
    Extrapolation of observed timings with test geometries to multi-GPU workstation
    core counts suggests performance sufficient for optical photon processing time to 
    become effectively zero compared to total simulation time is within reach.
