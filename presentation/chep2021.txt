Dear simon blyth,

We are contacting you as the submitter of the contribution "#45, Integration of
JUNO simulation framework with Opticks: GPU accelerated optical propagation via
NVIDIA OptiX" at the vCHEP’21 conference, due to be held online 17 - 21 May
2021, https://indico.cern.ch/e/vCHEP2021 . 

The program committee of the conference has rigorously reviewed your
contribution and we are happy to announce that your submission has been awarded
a presentation in a parallel session of the conference. 

We therefore invite you to start preparing a presentation for a slot of 8
minutes followed by a short discussion.  

As part of the review process we will provide you a first set of comments which
we ask you to consider for updating your paper and your presentation. The exact
instructions on how to proceed in the peer reviewing process will be sent to
you in the coming days. 

Just a few more points we would ask you to please follow up:

Please register for the conference. This is especially vital for the presenter,
as the registration timezone of the presenter will be used to build the
timetable. In case we cannot find the speaker timezone information by the end
of next week we may be forced to schedule the presentation on a best guess.    

If the presenter of the contribution has changed, will change or cannot be
decided right now, please inform the PC chairs (chep2021-pc-chairs@cern.ch).

Before the conference we will also contact all speakers with more preparatory
information about the setup of the conference sessions and detailed information
about the technical process we envisage for the session setups. 

Looking forward to meeting you at vCHEP’21

The PC chairs of vCHEP’21

Dear Colleagues

We are delighted to announce that the call for contributions to the 25th
(virtual) CHEP conference, which will be held from 17-21 May 2021 is now open.
We invite your submissions on advances in software and computing for the
high-energy and nuclear physics field.

Submissions should consist of a paper of 6-10 pages, following the instructions
for authors. Paper submission is open until 28 February 2021.

All relevant papers for the field that are scientifically sound will be accepted
In particular we strongly encourage submissions to vCHEP from early career researchers
Every accepted paper is guaranteed a slot at the conference, for at least a short presentation
Every accepted paper is eligible to be published in the conference proceedings
After the conference the papers can be revised, taking into account reviewer
comments and the discussion at vCHEP
If desired by the authors or their experiment the initial paper versions can be
kept confidential until the final versions are ready
A selection of the best papers, covering the most interesting and innovative
R&D in the field, will be invited to give a longer presentation in general
(plenary) sessions
We anticipate being able to have about 30 slots for these longer talk
Papers that cover an innovative topic in detail will be favoured for longer
talks over general review-type papers that summarise many items together
Some of the best plenary papers will be invited, at the authors’ discretion, to
be put forward for full journal publication

A reminder of important dates:
Paper submission opens:                        8 December 2020
Registration opens:                            1 February 2021

Paper acceptance notifications:                15 April 2021
Conference:                                    17-21 May 2021
