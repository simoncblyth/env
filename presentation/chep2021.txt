Dear Colleagues

We are delighted to announce that the call for contributions to the 25th
(virtual) CHEP conference, which will be held from 17-21 May 2021 is now open.
We invite your submissions on advances in software and computing for the
high-energy and nuclear physics field.

Submissions should consist of a paper of 6-10 pages, following the instructions
for authors. Paper submission is open until 28 February 2021.

All relevant papers for the field that are scientifically sound will be accepted
In particular we strongly encourage submissions to vCHEP from early career researchers
Every accepted paper is guaranteed a slot at the conference, for at least a short presentation
Every accepted paper is eligible to be published in the conference proceedings
After the conference the papers can be revised, taking into account reviewer
comments and the discussion at vCHEP
If desired by the authors or their experiment the initial paper versions can be
kept confidential until the final versions are ready
A selection of the best papers, covering the most interesting and innovative
R&D in the field, will be invited to give a longer presentation in general
(plenary) sessions
We anticipate being able to have about 30 slots for these longer talk
Papers that cover an innovative topic in detail will be favoured for longer
talks over general review-type papers that summarise many items together
Some of the best plenary papers will be invited, at the authorsâ€™ discretion, to
be put forward for full journal publication
