.. s5_talk:: 

    Opticks is an open source project that applies GPU ray tracing to optical photon simulation 
    and integrates this with Geant4. This can give drastic speedups of more than a factor of 1000.
    This approach removes memory and processing bottlenecks that can prevent the 
    optical photons from limiting simulations.  

    The actual speedup depends on your geometry and your effort in avoiding 
    geometry issues. 

    This render shows the photons resulting from a muon crossing the JUNO scintillator, 
    each line represents a single photon.

.. sidebar:: :small:`Huge CPU Memory+Time Expense`

    .. class:: small

         **JUNO Muon Simulation Bottleneck**
           ~99% CPU time, memory constraints

         **Ray-Geometry intersection Dominates**
           simulation is not alone in this problem...

         **Optical photons : naturally parallel, simple :**
           * produced by Cherenkov+Scintillation 
           * yield only Photomultiplier hits


.. s5_talk::

   So, what is the problem with optical photon simulation ? 

   A muon travelling across the JUNO scintillator yields tens of millions 
   of optical photons, presenting memory and time challenges. 

   At every step of every photon intersects between rays representing the 
   photons and the geometry have to be found.  This is what limits the simulation. 

   Simulation is not alone in this bottleneck.


.. comment

   Optical photons are naturally parallel : they can be considered 
   to be produced only by two processes : Cherenkov and Scintillation and we
   are interested in photons that hit the PMTs.  

   These characteristics make it straightforward integrate an external optical
   simulation.

.. s5_talk::

    So, how can GPU ray tracing help with simulation. 

    There is a lot in common between optical photon simulation and ray traced image rendering.   
    Simulation needs photon parameters at sensors, rendering needs pixel values at the image plane.

    Both these are limited by ray geometry intersection, which is also known as ray tracing.

    Ray tracing is widely used across many industries from advertising to games, so 
    there has been huge efforts to improve ray tracing performance, especially from NVIDIA.

    :i:`Rasterization vs Ray-tracing`

    .. s5_talk::

       Ray tracing and rasterization are the two primary graphics rendering techniques. 

       Rasterization is the most common rendering technique
       
       * it starts from the objects in a scene, and projects them onto pixels in the image plane
       * this requires an approximate triangulated geometry, to have vertices to project 
       
       Ray tracing 

       * starts from the pixels, casts rays out into the 3D scene and finds intersects
       * this can use analytic geometry, without approximation (just like Geant4)   
       * its easier to create realistic images with ray tracing because it is closer to the physics

       Ray tracing is an overloaded term.  In some contexts it means just the ray transport
       from an origin to an intersection. But is also refers more generally to the rendering technique.

            * aims to minimize bbox+primitive intersects 
            * accelerates ray-geometry intersection


    .. s5_talk::

       The principal technique to accelerate ray geometry intersection 
       is an acceleration structure called a bounding volume hierarchy 
       
       This divides space into progressively smaller boxes which forms
       a spatial index.

       Traversing the tree of bounds allows to minimize tests
       needed to find an intersect.

       Much of the acceleration structure traversal 
       is done in the dedicated RT cores.

    Opticks API : split according to dependency -- Optical photons are GPU "resident", only hits need to be copied to CPU memory 


.. s5_talk::

    This shows how Opticks is integrated with Geant4. The geometry is translated 
    and uploaded to the GPU at initialization.

    Cerenkov or Scintillation gensteps, the blue lines, are the generation parameters 
    uploaded to the GPU so optical photon generation can be done there.

    This allows the optical photon simulation to be entirely offloaded  
    to the GPU with only collected hits requiring memory on the CPU.

   Using that GPU CSG algorithm enabled : pure analytic ray trace-ing.  So that means the 
   geometry is not approximate any more, it can match Geant4 intersects very closely. 
   Its because the two implementations are solving the same polynomials.

   This compares the extrapolated Geant4 propagation time with the Opticks launch
   interval with RTX on.   The speedup is more than a factor of 1000.   Need to 
   use a log scale to make them both visible. 

   For 400M photons, Geant4 takes more than a day, Opticks takes less than a minute.   

   This is with analytic geometry. Speedup is a lot more with triangles.

   Having a large parallel speedup of 1000x or so

   * when developing a new simulation, its inevitable that will need to develop lots of tools for testing
   * many of them are directly applicable to testing DetSim and Geant4

   * i guess my plenary presentation at the CHEP conference at the end of 2019 is the main cause
   * also using GPUs with Geant4 has become a hot topic over the past year, with

.. s5_talk::


    IN 2019 NVIDIA introduced an entirely new OptiX API, which effectively meant that Opticks
    had to be full re-implemented

    In 2018 NVIDIA introduced a GPU with hardware dedicated to accelerating ray tracing.
    NVIDIA claims it can reach 10 billion ray geometry intersections per second
    with a single GPU. 

    Assuming each simulated photon costs 10 rays, that means the upper limit per GPU is 
    1 billion photons/second.

.. s5_talk::


    Due to the considerable interest in Opticks from many groups
    I have been fortunate to receive lots of help from NVIDIA engineers. 

    The Fermilab Geant4 Group was an early adopter of Opticks and has assisted by 
    developing a Geant4 advanced example demonstrating Opticks which 
    has been in the Geant4 distribution since 2021. 

    A group of experiments from the Dark Matter search community 
    made a significant contribution to Opticks development by organizing 
    a series of meetings with NVIDIA engineers that were very useful to 
    guide a re-implementation of Opticks to work with a completely new OptiX API.

.. s5_talk::

    Opticks brings state-of-the-art GPU ray tracing performance to optical photon 
    simulations. 

    The detailed validations needed when adopting a new simulation has a 
    hidden benefit in that detailed comparisons reveal problems with both 
    simulations. Adopting Opticks means you will 
    improve your CPU simulation whilst also giving you a GPU simulation.
