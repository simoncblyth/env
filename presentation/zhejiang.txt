Hi Simon,

Due to conflicts with another event, our trip is modified a bit:

* 21 Feb, Beijing - Jiangmen
* 26 Feb, Jiangmen - Hangzhou
* 27 Feb, you give a seminar on opticks at Zhejiang University. Then discuss the application of opticks.
* 28 Feb, Hangzhou - Beijing

Weidong tells me that they will create a poster for the seminar. Could you provide the title, abstract and your introduction? Thank you.

Tao



Title: 

    Opticks : Optical Photon Simulation via GPU Ray Tracing from NVIDIA® OptiX™

Abstract:

    Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation by
    integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via the NVIDIA OptiX 7 API, with
    Geant4 toolkit based simulations. A single NVIDIA Turing architecture GPU has 
    been measured to provide optical photon simulation speedup factors exceeding
    1500 times single threaded Geant4 with a full JUNO analytic GPU geometry
    automatically translated from the Geant4 geometry. Optical physics processes of
    scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission and boundary processes are 
    implemented in CUDA based on Geant4.  Wavelength-dependent material and surface
    properties as well as inverse cumulative distribution functions for reemission
    are interleaved into GPU textures providing fast interpolated property lookup
    or wavelength generation.

Introduction to Dr Simon C Blyth:

    Simon is a High Energy Physicist and Software Developer based at IHEP. 
    He gained his D.Phil in Particle Physics from Oxford University working 
    on the DELPHI experiment at LEP. Following that he worked on the L3 experiment 
    at CERN and BELLE expt at KEK. Subsequently he joined the Dayabay and JUNO experiments, 
    where he has been working on accelerating optical photon simulatiom 
    by integrating GPU ray tracing. This makes possible enormous speedup
    factors of more than 1000 times compared to serial processing.
