Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation by
integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via NVIDIA OptiX, with Geant4
toolkit based simulations. A single NVIDIA Turing architecture GPU has been
measured to provide optical photon simulation speedup factors exceeding 1500
times single threaded Geant4 with a full JUNO analytic GPU geometry
automatically translated from the Geant4 geometry. Optical physics processes of
scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission and boundary processes are
implemented within CUDA OptiX programs based on the Geant4 implementations.
Wavelength-dependent material and surface properties as well as inverse
cumulative distribution functions for reemission are interleaved into GPU
textures providing fast interpolated property lookup or wavelength generation.
In this work we describe major recent developments to facilitate integration of
Opticks with the JUNO simulation framework including on GPU collection
effciency hit culling which substantially reduces both the CPU memory needed
for photon hits and copying overheads. Also progress with the migration of
Opticks to the all new NVIDIA OptiX 7 API is described.
