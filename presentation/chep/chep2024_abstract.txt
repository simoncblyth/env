Opticks : GPU ray trace accelerated optical photon simulation

Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation 
by integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via the NVIDIA OptiX API, with
Geant4 toolkit based simulations. 
Optical photon simulation times of 14 seconds per 100 million photons 
have been measured within a fully analytic JUNO GPU geometry 
auto-translated from the Geant4 geometry when using a single NVIDIA GPU from
the first RTX generation. 
Optical physics processes of scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission 
and boundary processes are implemented in CUDA based on Geant4.  
Wavelength-dependent material and surface
properties as well as inverse cumulative distribution functions for reemission
are interleaved into GPU textures providing fast interpolated property lookup
or wavelength generation. In this work we describe the application of Opticks 
to JUNO simulation including new Opticks features that improve performance for 
complex CSG shapes and torus solids.
