CHEP Remote ?
----------------

* https://misportal.jlab.org/Ul/conferences/generic_conference/registration.cfm?conference_id=CHEP-23

Registration fee includes entrance to all sessions, coffee breaks, meeting
materials and other related costs. All participants are required to register.

NOTE: Remote Attendance options are being developed but are likely to involve
only Plenary Sessions at this stage. Options to view breakout sessions are
being investigated but will be limited at best. Remote Speakers/Presenters are
not supported at this time.

The Remote Attendance registration option will open on Feb 1, 2023. 


Abstract Submission
----------------------

1. register with jlab.indico 

* https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/abstracts/1356/


Instructions to speakers

Please submit your proposed presentation with an abstract for CHEP2023.

Submitters of contributions are required to select the appropriate track in
order to define the domain to which their paper corresponds. Please choose the
track carefully as submitting to the wrong track will slow down the reviewing
process.

Please select at least one of the authors as the speaker. This can be changed later if necessary.

Abstract guidelines

Selection of talks and posters will be made on the basis of submitted
abstracts. Parallel talks and posters will be organized in twelve tracks, as
indicated in the table below. The Program Committee will decide which
contributions will become oral presentations, and which become posters.
Exceptional contributions may be proposed for promotion to a plenary talk by
the Program Committee.

The recommended length of your abstract is 150-250 words, but there is no hard limit.

Submitters of abstracts are required to select an appropriate track;
optionally a second choice of track can be indicated; an abstract will be
assigned by the reviewers to only one track.

Consider carefully the track to which you wish to submit your paper -
submitting to the wrong track will slow down the process.  If you would like
your abstract to be considered for promotion to a plenary talk, please indicate
that.  If you have difficulty selecting a track from the list, please send an
email to chep2023-pc-chairs@jlab.org explaining the problem.

Submitters are also asked to ensure that their email addresses and those of the
proposed presenters are their primary email addresses.




Procedure : High Level Defocussed view of developments since last presentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review presentations and notes:

* https://simoncblyth.bitbucket.io
* ~/opticks/notes/progress.rst 

Look for "hook" items to include in abstract "update" sentences 

* pick the most important three items 
* need to cover both what is actually important and 
  also give things that interest people


CHEP 2023
-----------

1. Migration to the all new NVIDIA OptiX 7 API 

  * from the ground up reimplementation of entire optical simulation 
  * major code reductions, 

2. Improved performance for highly complex solids using CSG list-nodes that avoid tree overheads 

  * better match intersection code with the geometry 

3. TMM calculations to account for interference effects in thin layers 


HMM: the first item is far more important and is far more work that the rest 
should reflect that in the coverage.
Actually the infrastructure improvements have enabled the other developments.

    Opticks : GPU Optical Photon Simulation using NVIDIA OptiX 7 and NVIDIA CUDA

    Opticks is an open source project that accelerates optical photon simulation by
    integrating NVIDIA GPU ray tracing, accessed via the NVIDIA OptiX 7 API, with Geant4
    toolkit based simulations. A single NVIDIA Turing architecture GPU has been
    measured to provide optical photon simulation speedup factors exceeding 1500
    times single threaded Geant4 with a full JUNO analytic GPU geometry
    automatically translated from the Geant4 geometry. Optical physics processes of
    scattering, absorption, scintillator reemission and boundary processes are
    implemented in CUDA based on Geant4.
    Wavelength-dependent material and surface properties as well as inverse
    cumulative distribution functions for reemission are interleaved into GPU
    textures providing fast interpolated property lookup or wavelength generation.

    In this work we describe the near complete re-implementation of geometry and optical simulation 
    required to adopt the entirely new NVIDIA OptiX 7 API, with the implementation now 
    directly CUDA based with OptiX usage restricted to providing intersects.  
    The new Opticks features a modular many small header design that provides fine grained 
    testing both on GPU and CPU as well as substantial code reductions from CPU/GPU sharing. 
    Enhanced modularity has enabled CSG tree generalization to support "list-nodes", similar to G4MultiUnion, 
    that improve performance for complex CSG solids. 
    Recent addition of support for interference effects in boundaries with multiple thin layers, 
    such as anti-reflection coatings and photocathodes, using CUDA compatible transfer matrix 
    method (TMM) calculations of reflectance, transmittance and absorptance is also reported.

    In this work we describe major recent developments to facilitate integration of
    Opticks with the JUNO simulation framework including on GPU collection
    efficiency hit culling which substantially reduces both the CPU memory needed
    for photon hits and copying overheads. Also progress with the migration of
    Opticks to the all new NVIDIA OptiX 7 API is described.

    cores available in NVIDIA RTX series GPUs. Results of extensive validation
    tests are presented.
