Please draft a CHEP 2026 conference abstract for a presentation of 
progress with Opticks and its usage together with the JUNO simulation
software. The recommended length of an abstract is 100-250 words.
The abstracts should clearly highlight new methods/results developed
in addition to introducing Opticks. 

The new developments listed below were motivated by mainly from 
feedback from JUNO users doing simulation production.


* new measurements of JUNOSW+Opticks performance in production

* integration of Opticks build, test and release with JUNOSW gitlab based CI/CD system

* stress testing Opticks simulation with 8.25 billion photon events in order to 
  cleanly handle the largest of double and multiple muon events

* addition of 16 byte photon rather than the normal 64 byte photon giving option 
  for reduced resource simulation when summary information is required, 
  eg for very large photon count events

* implementation of CUDA Thrust based hit merging, using thrust::sort_by_key
  and thrust::reduce_by_key giving  


The below developments are not as well developed as the above. So they should
be mentioned as being experimental in nature.

* implementation of server/client Opticks, using FastAPI python server integrated with Opticks via 
  nanobind. This enables non-GPU nodes to benefit from Opticks GPU acceleration via libcurl based 
  communication to Opticks server, increases GPU utilization. 


Just an idea, so far:

* progressive async CUDA launches doing GPU optical photon simulation that overlaps 
  with the Geant4 simulation of all other particles
