Regarding CHEP2023, I noticed from the registration page 
(link and extract below) that remote presentation is not supported.   
I had the impression that the conference was going to 
be fully hybrid, perhaps they are backpedaling on this ?

Possibly the CHEP2023 organizers need some "high level official” 
encouragement in order to get them to arrange support for 
remote presentations in plenary and parallel sessions ?


https://misportal.jlab.org/Ul/conferences/generic_conference/registration.cfm?conference_id=CHEP-23

Registration fee includes entrance to all sessions, coffee breaks, meeting materials
and other related costs. All participants are required to register. 

NOTE: Remote Attendance options are being developed but are likely to involve only
Plenary Sessions at this stage. Options to view breakout sessions are being investigated
but will be limited at best. Remote Speakers/Presenters are not supported at this time. 
The Remote Attendance registration option will open on Feb 1, 2023.
