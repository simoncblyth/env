Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to present the Second Bulletin on the 26th Computing in High
Energy & Nuclear Physics (CHEP) conference, which will be held from 8-12 May
2023 in Norfolk, Virginia, USA.

Updates: - The call for contributions opened in August and will be closing in a
few weeks on 17 November 2022.  ** Please submit your Abstract ASAP! **

- Provisional Registration is Open! This will allow people to register while
  deferring payment of a registration fee until later, allowing extra time for
  travel planning and visa applications. The early registration discount expires
  on February 15.

- Book your Hotel ASAP to lock-in River View Hotel Rooms, and book a spot on
  one of the many exciting Excursions (Kayaking, Glass Blowing, Botanical
  Gardens, Bridge-Tunnel ‘Behind the Scenes’ Tour, and more!)  Slots are limited
  so book now!


Selection of talks and posters will be made on the basis of submitted
abstracts. The Program Committee will decide which contributions will become
oral presentations, and which become posters. Exceptional contributions may be
proposed for promotion to a plenary talk by the Program Committee. 

- The recommended length of your abstract is 150-250 words, but there is no
  hard limit.  - If you have difficulty submitting your abstract please send an
