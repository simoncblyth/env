Regarding my abstract entitled:
"Opticks : GPU Optical Photon Simulation using NVIDIA OptiX 7 and NVIDIA CUDA"
Thank you for selecting this for Oral presentation at the conference. 

Unfortunately due to visa and travel uncertainties related to my imminent 
return to China from the UK following re-opening and other uncertainties
regarding the formalities of resuming work in China I will be unable to 
travel to the US in May to attend the CHEP2023 conference. 

As remote presentation is not supported I am forced to withdraw my 
contribution to CHEP 2023.

Simon
