   - tighten up trac permissions , only registered users to
     have any edit permissions 

   - verify SVN permissions

  IDEAS

   - wiki text management ?  i want SVN-trac Wiki mirroring 

        1) its not good that the wiki text is only residing on one machine ...
		2) web editing is a pain 
		3) trac-admin provides export and import
	           trac-admin $SCM_FOLD/env wiki export 
           dump the pages into folder to be placed in SVN ?

       ... look for or implement SVN hooks that import into the
	       trac wiki when commits are made into a particular folder in the
	       repository 

       ... howabout wiki edits thru the web interface 
	  
              /base
	       env/dyw
              /scm
			  /wiki/WikiStartPage 
	
  BACKBURNER

   - make the env totally relative , allowing it to be rooted anywhere

  DONE

   - run apache2 as service in hfag, in order to benefit from auto restarts
     after powercuts
