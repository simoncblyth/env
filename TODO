  with apache2 running as "nobody" spawned from root 
  
    The user root requires read _and_ write permission to the database file
    /var/scm/tracs/test/db/trac.db and the directory it is located in.


  got trac going to some extent by creating the repository as the
  same user that apache2 is running as "www" , with :  

     TSUDO="sudo -u www"
     scm-use-create-local test Desktop/kambiu-ten-pages


  then safari complains "lost network connection" and see the
  apache2-error-log 

  /usr/local/python/Python-2.5.1/lib/python2.5/site-packages/trac/web/clearsilver.py:128:
  RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module neo_util: This
  Python has API version 1013, module neo_util has version 1012.





  TODO

   - tighten up trac permissions , only registered users to
     have any edit permissions 

   - verify SVN permissions


  DEBUG NOTE 

    use: bash -lvc "command" to verbosely echo lines before execution 



  IDEAS

   - wiki text management ?  i want SVN-trac Wiki mirroring 

        1) its not good that the wiki text is only residing on one machine ...
		2) web editing is a pain 
		3) trac-admin provides export and import
	           trac-admin $SCM_FOLD/env wiki export 
           dump the pages into folder to be placed in SVN ?

       ... look for or implement SVN hooks that import into the
	       trac wiki when commits are made into a particular folder in the
	       repository 

       ... howabout wiki edits thru the web interface 
	  
              /base
	       env/dyw
              /scm
			  /wiki/WikiStartPage 
	
  BACKBURNER

   - make the env totally relative , allowing it to be rooted anywhere

  DONE

   - run apache2 as service in hfag, in order to benefit from auto restarts
     after powercuts
