\section{Neutrinos}

In the early 1900s, William Bragg demonstrated that mono-energetic $\alpha$-rays
were emitted in $\alpha$ decays, which are two-body decays. Therefore $\beta$-rays
were supposed to be mono-energetic also because of 2-body decay of protons and
electrons. Nevertheless, C.D. Ellis and J. Chadwich showed that the $\beta$-ray
spectrum was continuous. Fig. \ref{fig:inverse_beta_decay_spectrum.png} shows the typical beta-rays energy distribution curve.

    \end{figure}


Pauli postulated a tiny neutron particle which we call neutrino today. The neutrino
of $\beta$ decay carrys away some energy so it's a 3-body decay.

The neutrions are not observed directly. Only the products from their interactions
with matter are observed. A particular neutrino flavor is associated to the obseved lepton type.
Our reference to neutrino mass is the effective mass
associated with the flavor state.
There are three flavors of neutrinos: electron neutrino $\mu_e$, muon neutrino $\mu_{\nu}$, and
tau neutrino $\mu_{tau}$.

\section{The Dayabay Neutrino Oscillation Experiment}
\subsection{Overview}

A deep underground neutrino observatory at Dayabay, China, has
been proposed. \cite{TDR}
Dayabay is nearby Hong Kong. See Figure \ref{fig:googleMap.png}


\begin{figure}
    \label{fig:googleMap.png}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{googleMap.png}
    \caption

$The\,dot\,at\,the\,lower-left\,of\,the\,map:$ Aberdeen Tunnel.
The distance between Dayabay and Aberdeen Tunnel is around 90 km.}
    \end{figure}


The idea to measure $\theta_{13}$ is to use two or more antineutrino detectors
to measure the survival or disappearance probability of reactor antineutrino, which is electron-type antineutrino.
The observed survival probability associated to different distance could be derived 
%------------------------
%from the MNS matrix :
%-------------------------


\begin{equation}
\label{equ:survivalProb}
P_{ee} = 1 - \sin^{2}{2\theta_{13}}\sin^{2}{\frac{{\Delta}m^{2}_{31}L}{4E_{\mu}}} - \cos^{4}{\theta_{13}}\sin^{2}{2\theta_{12}}\sin^{2}{\frac{{\Delta}m^{2}_{21}L}{4E_{\mu}}}
\end{equation}


Thus compare the ratio of interaction rates in multiple detectors as \ref{equ:compareDetectorsRatio}, and
the survival probability term shows the $\sin^{2}{\theta_{13}}$.


\begin{equation}
\label{equ:compareDetectorsRatio}
\frac{N_{f}}{N_{n}} = (\frac{N_{p,f}}{N_{p,n}})(\frac{L_n}{L_f})^{2}(\frac{\epsilon_f}{\epsilon_n})[\frac{P_{sur}(E,L_f)}{P_{sur}(E,L_n)}]
\end{equation}


Dayabay anti-neutrino detectors (AD), which will discussed more in section \ref{sec:AD},
will be placed at Dayabay. They will be placed at varying distance from the Dayabay reactor and
the Ling Ao reatcors as shown in \ref{fig:location_dayabay.png}. There are two sets of near detectors
at near sites, close to the Dayabay reactor and the Ling Ao reactors respectively, and two modules each set.
There is one set of far detectors, and four modules are there. The Dayabay near site with an overburden of
255 m.w.e.is located at a distance of 363m from the Dayabay cores. The Ling Ao near sitewith an overburden of
294 m.w.e. is 481m and 526m from the Ling Ao I and Ling Ao II cores respectively. The far site is at the distance
of 1985m and 1615m from the Dayabay cores and the mid-pointof the Ling Ao-Ling Ao II cores, and has an overburden
of 910 m.w.e.

At the time of writing, the Ling Ao II cores is still under construction and are going to be built and run in around
2011. This effect should be study and has been studied by Dayabay collaborators.

The baseline between the near site AD and far site AD associated to the neutrino oscillation
location is shown in Figure \ref{fig:oscillation}

The main backgrounds to the Dayabay Experiement are induced by cosmic-ray muons.
The site is located adjacent to mountainous terrain, ideal for sitting underground detectors that
are well shield from external backgrounds like cosmogeic backgrounds including the cosmic-ray mouons.
However, background due to the muon spallation products at the depths of the experiment halls and ambient
$\gamma$ background due to the radioactivity of the rock surrounding the experiment halls is reduced by shielding
the ADs with 2.5 meterof water. This water shield also attenuates the flux of neutrons produced outside the water
pool.

Events with a muons that passes through the water in the water pool less than 200 $\mu$s, which is the typical time window bewtween
a prompt signal and a delayed signal of an inverse-beta decay process, have a small but finite
probability to create a fake signal event.
There is a layer of  Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) above a water pool
and 8" PMTs arround the water pool for the Cherenkov detection of muons to tag such muon signals.
The setup is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:water_pool.png}.

\section{The Dayabay Anti-neutrino Detectors}
\label{sec:AD}

Dayabay antineutrino is a 3-zone detector. See Figure \ref{fig:3zone.png}
The inner most zone is the antineutrino target, which
is 0.1\% Gd-doped liquid scintillator. The second zone
is the gamma catcher, which is liquid scintillator only.
The outer most zone is the mineral oil buffer.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figure/introduction/3zone.png}
    \caption
    [3-zone structure of Dayabay antineutrino detector]

$Right:$ Scheatic top view of the three different zones o the antineutrino detector.}
    \label{fig:3zone.png}
    \end{figure}


The detection mechanism is inverse $\beta$ decay.


\begin{equation}
\overline{\nu_e} + p \rightarrow e^+ + n
\label{InverseBetaDecay}
\end{equation}


The positrons will anniheas soon after they are generated by the inverse beta-decay,
and generate gammas which could be observed by PMTs. The neutrons will go through
thermal scattering process and finally captured by nuclies, namely protons. This
process will generate a 2.2Mev gamma each event, and it is a delayed signal comparing
to the positon annilesas.


\begin{equation}
n + p \rightarrow D + \gamma (2.2 MeV)
\label{NeutronPCapture}
\end{equation}


The cross section of the neutron captured by protons process is 0.3b, so a 0.1\%Gd-doped
is proposed. The cross section of neutrons captured by Gd is 50000b. The Gd will be excited
after capturing neutrons and go back to ground state by emitting gammas, totally 8 MeV. This
process is also a delayed comparing to the positron annealing.


\begin{equation}
n + Gd \rightarrow Gd^*
\label{NeutronGdCapture}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
Gd^* \rightarrow Gd + \Sigma \gamma (8 MeV)
\label{GdStarToGd}
\end{equation}


The prompt and delayed signals are time-tagged signals.
Together with the energy-tagged signals, the inverse beta-decay
in 0.1\% Gd-doped liquid scintillator is a good tool to suppress
background events.


(inverse beta decay and signal scheme)


The inverse beta-decay is adopted as the signals of Dayabay antineutrino detectors.
The measurement of $\sin^{2}_{2\theta_{13}}$ to less than 0.01 corresponds to a small
difference in a lot of antineutrino events observed between the far site and
the near site.

The delayed signals are generated by the neutrons of inverse beta-decay process.
Neutrons are neutral so the cross section with matters is small.
A large mass antineutrino detector should be in the order of tons.
Typical requirement of an antineutrino detector is summarized in Table \ref{tab:ADRequirement}


\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Physical requirements of the antineutrio detector\cite{TDR}}
\label{tab:ADRequirement}
\begin{tabular}{lp{2.5cm}p{5.0cm}}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


It's simpler to simulate and analysis the antineutrino detectors if they are
symmetric, so a sphere or a cylinder shape could be considered. The cylinder
shape is easier to produce from the point of engineering view, and also lower
price. Thus the antineutrino detectors are designed based on the cylinder shape.

The delayed signal are the 2.2MeV and 8MeV neutrons . There are external backgrounds like
muon-induced neutrons, radioactivity of PMT glasses, natural radioactivity of rock,
buffer water etc. Mineral oil is used for the antineutrino detectors to be a buffer.

Accroding to the neutron capture processes, by protons and by Gd, and the buffer to
suppress the background, 2-zone and 3-zone detectors are considered. The innermost
zone is the antineutrino target, composed of the liquid scintillator doped 1\% Gd.
The second zone is the gamma catcher, composed of the liquid scintillator, for a
3-zone detector or the mineral oil for a 2-zone detector. The outermost zone
is the mineral oil for a 3-zone.

(overview of the 2-zone and 3-zone antineutrino detecotrs)


The comparison for 2-zone and 3-zone detectors shows 
uncertainty of the neutron energy threshold, caused by uncertainty in the energy scale.
3-zone detectors could have better energy resolution where the energy scale
uncertainty is taken to be 1\% and 1.2\% at 6MeV and 4 MeV, respectively.

(table of the comparison)

Thus 3-zone detectors are used. The innermost GdLS is 20 tons and the outer layer is another
20 tons of the unloaded  liquid scintillator. The outermost is 40 tons of mineral oil. 192 eight-inch
Hamamatsu photomutiplier tubes (PMTs) are mounted on the inner surface of the stainless steel tank
in eight horizontal rings, viewing the target volume and the gamma catcher. The crooss-sectional model of an AD
is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:AD_module.png}.
