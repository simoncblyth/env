\section{A experiment at Aberdeen}

The Dayabay antineutrino signal is composed of a prompt positron signal and a delayed
neutron signal. Although the time and energy tagged signals could be powerful tool to suppress
the background, there are still accidental coincidence signals. Any signal happens during
the typical time window after the prompt position signals occurred from 30 micro-second to 120 micro-second,
which is the typical thermal neutron drifting time, 
could be regarded as a antineutrino candidate. These accidnetal coincidence signals could be
muon-induced neutrons, radioactivity of PMT glasses, natural radioactivity of rock
( usually $^{238}U$, $^{232}Th$, and $^{40}K$) etc. The $(\alpha,n)$ processes may also produce
neutrons from natural radio-nuclides. Cosmogenic $^8He$ and $^9Li$ can undergo beta-neutron decay,
and this may also mimick neutrons from inverse-beta decay.

%The radioactivity of PMT could be known by studying the ingredient of the PMTs and decreased
%by the mineral oil buffer. The other natural radioactivity, like rock or dusts in the 
%air could be studied or monitored directly. Muon-induced neutron is a complicated
%process and needed measured the flux directly.

A muon-induced neutron detector is proposed to measure muon-induced neutron flux at Aberdenn, Hong Kong,
about 90 km away from Dayabay as shown in Figure \ref{fig:googleMap.png}.
The detector is positioned at a vertical overburden of ~600 m.w.e. in Aberdeen tunnel, and the rock of the tunnel
providing shielding of many cosmic rays. Muon, which has lower attenuation length in rock, could
survives after passing through the rock above the tunnel.

Aberdeen is nearby Dayabay and with similar geological composition as Dayabay. Figure \ref{fig:abtRock.png}
shows the comparison of the rock composition.
The Aberdeen Tunnel Experiment is aimed to study those backgrounds encountered by the Dayabay
Experiment. The main focus of the Aberdeen Experiment is to study cosimic-ray muons in terms
of measuring their angular distribution, flux and contribution to neutron background in an
underground environment like the Dayabay site. The similar geological composition
is expected to lead into the similar muon-induced neutron background at Dayabay and Aberdeen.

The setup of the Aberdeen Tunnel Experiment is similar to Dayabay and consists of
two parts, the muon tracker and the neutron detecotr as shown in Figure \ref{fig:abtExp.png}. The neutron detector is placed in the
middle of the muon tracker.
More details of the neutron detector will be disscussed in section \ref{sec:ND}.

The muon tracker, which consists of 63 scintillator hodoscopes and 72 proportional
tubes arranged in six layers.
Three layers are above the neutron detector and three layers are below the neutron detector seperately.
The top layer consists of 30 scintillator hodoscope of 1 m long and 10 cm wide with
one end readout by 2-inch PMTs. The second layer consists of 24 proportional tubes of diameters of
7.6 cm and lengths of 2 m placed orthogonal to the top layer. the third layer consists of 18 1.5 m-long
and 10 cm-wide scintillator hodoscope with one end readout by a 2" PMT. The forth layer is a row
of 24 proportional tubes of diameters of 7.6cm and lengths of 2 m placed orthogonal to the third layer.
The fifth layer is made up of 15 2m-long and 9.3 cm-wide scintillator hodoscope with both end
readout by Hamamatsu 7826 Small PMTs (SPMT). The last layer is an array of 24 proportional tubes
of diameters of 7.6 cm and lengths of 2 m placed  orthogonal to the fifth layer.

The coincidence of the top and bottom muon trackers can tag the muon candidates
associated to the neutron signals in the neutron detector. Neutron signals occurred
in the time window after muon candidates are tagged from 30 micro-second to
120 micro-second, would be regarded as muon-induced neutron signal candidates.
The scheme of data acquisition is shown in Figure \ref{fig:abtDataFlow}.

\section{The Neutron Detector at Aberdeen}
\label{sec:ND}
\subsection{Design and Signals}

The neutron detector of Aberdeen Tunnel Experiment is similar to the
anti-neutrino detectors of Dayabay Experiment. A Dayabay anti-neutrino
detector is a neutron detector in essence. A Dayabay antineutrino detector is a
3-zone detector and a Aberdeen neutron detector is a 2-zone detector.
Figure \ref{fig:abtNeutronDetector} and \ref{fig:abtND} show the structure.

Because of limitation of the tunnel space, a 2-zone neutron detector is used.
The inner zone is composed of a cylindrical acrylic tank with a diamter of 110 cm and a height of 80 cm,
filled with liquid scintillator doped with 0.1\% Gd to be the neutron target and
the outer zone is composed of mineral oil. There are 16 8" Hamamatzu R1408 PMTs in the mineral oil and viewing the target.
All of these are positioned inside a square steel tank with dimension 160 cm $*$ 160 cm $*$ 113 cm. The 16 PMTs
are arranged in four columns, mounted in the four coners of the steel tank. On top and beneath the acrylic tank is
a sheet of Miro-Silver \cite{MiroSilver} with a diameter of 152 cm and a thickness of 0.5 mm, for reflecting photons and
enhancing the photon number received by PMTs.
%This kind of Miro-Silver is so called the reflector and will be discussed later in section \ref{sec:reflector}.
The Miro-Silver sheet is attached on a acrylic panel of thickness of 3 mm by 3M DP810 \cite{3M} glue.

Besides the top and bottom specular reflectors, there are diffuse reflector on the inner surface of the stainless steel tank.
The diffuse reflector is a tyvek 1085D sheet.\cite{tyvek}
