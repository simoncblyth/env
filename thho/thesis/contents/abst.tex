Dayabay neutrino experiment is a high-precision measurement experiement
of the reactor anti-electron neutrino flux at Dayabay to search for theta-13.
Neutrons are generated from the anti-electron neutrinos by a anti-beta decay
process. The measurement of neutron events can derivate the neutrino events.

Thus the neutron background in Dayabay neutrino experiment is significant.
Aberdeen muon-induced netron detector monitors the neutron backgound from the
cosmic rays which most of them are mouns, nearby Dayabay.
