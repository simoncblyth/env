\chapter {Summary and Conclusion}

The fabrication experience of inner acrylic vessel for Dayabay AD
is now mature.
The QA items are also established, including optical property, geometry, and
cleanliness.
The manufacture time of the inner acrylic vessels by Nakano
could be shorter for the remaining 6 inner acrylic vessels.
It's expected the 6 inner acrylic vessels could be completed in one year.

The Aberdeen neutron detector is now running and at the stage of calibration.
The Aberdeen neutron detector reconstruction algorithm is completed and
now used for the calibration data.
This is a first test of the GA for Aberdeen neutron detector and real data.


\section {Outlook}

The Dayabay first pair of AD will begin running on March 2009.
The other ADs will be completed in the following 1 year.
Namely all the ADs for the far site and near sites
will run on the middle of 2010.
Accroding to the sensitivity study,
it needs around 3 year to approach the goal of 0.01 or better.

The preliminary measurement of $\theta_{13}$ is expected
to be accessed before the coming of 2014.


The integration of online and offline system of the Aberdeen experiment is at the final stage.
Towards the end of this year, the Aberdeen experiment is expected to taking data.
It is hoped that the Aberdeen experiment could provide the neutron background for
the Dayabay Reactor Neutrino Experiment before the coming of the Dayabay first pair of
AD Dry Run.
