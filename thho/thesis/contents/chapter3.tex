\subsection {Acrylic Optical Property in Detectors}

The signal region of both Dayabay detectors and Aberdeen detector
is around from 350nm to 450nm, namely blue region of visible light.
The signal region is decided by the PMT gain, the LS and the GdLS emitting spectrum and
the attenuation spectrum, the mineral oil attenuation spectrum, and
the acrylic panels spectrum.

(overview of the coupling spectrum by Joseph)

A typical commercial acrylic panel is often doped UV absorber
to prevent aging of acrylic panel. This kind of UV absorber makes acrylic spectrum
UV-blocked and the typical cut-off trasmission is at around 350nm to 400nm,
which happens to signal region of optical photon.
Thus the acrylic panels used for the acrylic vessels should be chosen as
UV-transparent ones.

Nervertheless, not only as-received acrylic material property, but also as-cast
acrylic material should be monitored. Three kinds of manufacture process happen to the acrylic panels.
They are polish, bonding and annealing, including heating the panels to shape them. Besides,
the aging of acrylic panels will be discussed too.

\subsubsection {Bonding and Aging}

IAVs are produced by Nakano Int., Taiwan. Nakano uses a kind of glue, which is basically
composed of PMMA, to bond the acrylic panels of IAV. The process to produce this kind of glue is a commercial
secret. Nakano claims the glue is pure PMMA. The glue needs a process so called UV curing. The bonding area
is compose of acrylc panels and glue, and exposured to UV lamps. To cure a 2mm thick bonding
area, a 10W UV lamp is needed to irradiate the area for around 2 days, depending on the manufacutre status of glue
and the thickness of acrylic panels. This kind of UV curing process is observed that it changes transmission of acrylic panels,
and both increasing and decreasing effect could happen, depending on different kinds of acrylic panel.


(LJ's reflector acrylic panels show the decreasing effect)



(IAV 10mm increasing)


Fig. IAV 10mm increasing shows the transmission will fit in with the QA in around 1 month, which is longer than typical
bonding time, 2~3 days. So the UV curing is allowed to produce IAVs.

A similar effect could be observed when acrylic panels are exposure to the sunshine. Fig shows different
acrylic panels exposured to the sunshine responds differently.

(Bryce, LJ, and my figure)


Nevertheless, the transmission measured on different date of acrylic panels without exposuing to the sunshine directly,
shows slightly variance in around a year, which is longer than typical acrylic vessel manufacture time.
Thus the acrylic vessels should be avoid to be exposured to the sunshine directly.

\subsection {A Spectrometer and Integrating sphere}

A spectrometer with a integrating sphere is used for the QA/QC
of the acrylic optical property including
the transmission, reflection, index of refraction, and attenuation length.
The spectrometer is Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 with the 60mm integrating sphere.

Lambda 650 is a double beams spectrometer. One is reference beam and another is
sample beam. All transmission meausrement is ratio of sample beam intensity to
reference beam. Refernce beam and sample beam are frequently calibrated in air.

This Lambda 650 has tungsten and deturian light source, and they cover UV/VIS/NIR
range. For Dayabay antineutrino detectors, the PMT/LS/GdLS coupling wavelength range
is around 350nm to 450nm. The QA/QC of the acrylic panels provides the spectrum
from 200nm to 800nm, that is, covers the sensitive wavelength range.

The outcoming light source of the Lambda 650 has around 30\%-70\% polarization.
