\subsection {A Spectrometer and Integrating sphere}

A spectrometer with a integrating sphere is used for the QA/QC
of the acrylic optical property including
the transmission, reflection, index of refraction, and attenuation length.
The spectrometer is Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 with the 60mm integrating sphere.

Lambda 650 is a double beams spectrometer. One is reference beam and another is
sample beam. All transmission meausrement is ratio of sample beam intensity to
reference beam. Refernce beam and sample beam are frequently calibrated in air.

This Lambda 650 has tungsten and deturian light source, and they cover UV/VIS/NIR
range. For Dayabay antineutrino detectors, the PMT/LS/GdLS coupling wavelength range
is around 350nm to 450nm. The QA/QC of the acrylic panels provides the spectrum
from 200nm to 800nm, that is, covers the sensitive wavelength range.

The outcoming light source of the Lambda 650 has around 30\%-70\% polarization.
