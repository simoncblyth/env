Bloomenthal on Implicit surfaces: understandable intro to math foundations

Implicit function theorem parallels closed requirement for boolean **solids**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the implicit function theorem it may be shown that for f(p) = 0, where 0 a
regular value of f and f is continuous, the implicit surface is a
two-dimensional manifold [Bruce and Giblin 1992, prop. 4.16]. The
Jordan-Brouwer Separation Theorem states that such a manifold separates space
into the surface itself and two connected open sets: an infinite `outside' and
a finite â€˜inside' [Guillemin and Pollack 1974].

Non-manifold Surfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* http://www.unchainedgeometry.com/jbloom/pdf/dis-chptr4-nonman.pdf

::

    As described in section 3.5.4, implicit surfaces are two-dimensional manifolds.
    That is, they envelope a volume. A manifold surface is, everywhere, locally
    homomorphic (that is, of comparable structure) to a two-dimensional disk
    (manifold surfaces with boundary are everywhere homomorphic to a disk or a
    half- disk). For example, a disk may be fully applied to any portion of the
    torus below, left. But, the disk does not fully apply to all points of a
    teapot, below, right. In particular, the disk is truncated along the upper
    boundary of the teapot bowl.


The contortions required to model non-manifold surfaces... discussed
in the above makes living with the **closed sub-object** "limitation" of CSG **solids**
seem a price well worth paying.



Grokking SDFs
---------------


Can SDFs model a bounded cylinder with no endcaps ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :google:`signed distance function closed surface`

* are signed distance functions limited to closed surfaces ?


* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659211/

Indeed, in the codimension one case, there is a clearly defined interior and a
clearly defined exterior of the given object of interest, if the surface is
closed. In this case, a signed distance function can be used for a level set
implementation of the evolution equation.



Combining SDF with CSG operations
------------------------------------------


* complement(SDF) = -SDF                      # think of flipping the normals
* union(SDF_A,SDF_B) = min(SDF_A, SDF_B)      # think of distance to union of two overlapping spheres 
* intersect(SDF_A,SDF_B) = max(SDF_A, SDF_B)
* difference(SDF_A,SDF_B) = intersect(SDF_A, -SDF_B) = max(SDF_A, -SDF_B)

* negate to complemement
* difference is intersect with the complement

                           -ve inside

Slab is a difference of half-spaces

* sdfA = z - h      (plane at z = h) 
* sdfB = z + h      (plane at z = -h ),  
* ~sdfB = -(z+h)    (same position, but now inside are upwards to +z)

::

    intersect(sdfA, ~sdfB) 
    max( z - h , -(z + h) )
    max( z - h , -z - h )
    max(z, -z) - h
    abs(z) - h 



min/max/abs identities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

box
~~~~~

Box - signed - exact

::

    float sdBox( vec3 p, vec3 b )
    {
      vec3 d = abs(p) - b;  
      return min(max(d.x,max(d.y,d.z)),0.0) + length(max(d,0.0));
    }


::

    abs(p) ->  fold space into one "quadrant"

    vec3 d = abs(p) - b  (presumably b=box.max)
        ->  conveniently the origin planes now split inside/outside 

    when inside the box d.x,d.y,d.z will all be -ve so: max(d,0.0) -> 0 
    the larger of the -ve d.xyz will be the closest distance to the surface 
        min(max(d.x,max(d.y,d.z)),0.0)

    when outside the box, maximal d coord will be +ve so min(maximal, 0) 
    will get clamped at zero and the other term comes into play 

        length(max(d,0.0))


  Note the handling of two cases using min and max clamped to zero
       min( f(d), 0 ) + max( g(d), 0 )
