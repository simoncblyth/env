In addition to the A100, A800, H100, H800, L40, L40S, US authorities are
banning shipments of the GeForce RTX 4090. The graphics card is based on the
Ada Lovelace generation AD102-300-A1 graphics chip. Since export restrictions
are performance-based, it is possible that the threshold will be lowered again
in the future.

The AD102-300-A1 processor is manufactured by TSMC using 5nm technology. It has
76.3 billion transistors with a density of 125.3 mm per square millimetre. The
graphics card was unveiled in September 2022 and went on sale a few weeks after
the announcement with prices starting at $1600.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On October 17, 2023, the U.S. Government, or USG, announced that it submitted the Interim Final Rule, “Implementation of Additional Export Controls: Certain Advanced Computing Items; Supercomputer and Semiconductor End Use; Updates and Corrections” (the “Interim Final Rule”) for publication in the Federal Register.
The Interim Final Rule amends ECCN 3A090 and 4A090 and imposes additional licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of the Company’s integrated circuits exceeding certain performance thresholds (including but not limited to the A100, A800, H100, H800, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090). Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX and HGX systems) is also covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement includes future NVIDIA integrated circuits, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090 or 4A090, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.

The licensing requirement applies to the export of products classified ECCN 3A090 or 4A090 to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.

The licensing requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers of covered products, or supply customers of covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.

To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new licensing requirements, the Company may seek a license for the customer but has no assurance that the USG will grant any exceptions or licenses, or that the USG will act on the request in a timely manner.

The Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2024 ends on October 29, 2023. The Interim Final Rule is effective thirty days after its publication. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that the additional restrictions will have a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.
