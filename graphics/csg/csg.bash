CSG : Constructive Solid Geometry
==================================

Overview : CSG to B-REP aka CSG Polygonization aka Meshing 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Have implemented within Opticks:

* MC : marching cubes
* DCS : dual contouring sample, using Octree
* IM : implicit mesher

These three all form the isosurface mesh using only the implicit 
signed distance function for the composite CSG solid. 
Details of the research that went into that in isosurface-.

**None of these approaches cope well with very thin solids, such as the cathode.**


Need to get more information into the algorithm ... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* parametric descriptions of all primitives are not difficult to come up with, 
  perhaps these can be used to guide the meshing algorithms ? 

* perhaps some kind of hybrid parametric/implicit approach is called for ?

CSG Trees that do not have any difference operator are called positive trees.
Each CSG tree can be rewritten as a positive tree by applying De Morgan's laws
(results in complemented primitives).
Studying active zones and S-bounds is much simpler with positive trees.

Blist
~~~~~~~

* http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarek/papers/Blist.pdf
* ~/opticks_refs/csg_Blist.pdf

The CSG-to-Blist conversion process takes as input the root-node of the binary
tree, T, and produces the corresponding BL table. Both structures have been
described above. The conversion performs the following steps:

1. Convert T into a positive form by applying deMorganâ€™s laws and propagating complements to the leaves
2. Rotate the tree by switching the left and right children at each node to make the tree left heavy
3. Visit the leaves from left to right and for each leaf, p, fill in the corresponding fields of BL[p]

* http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1576/090.pdf

CSG Converting To Positive Form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CSG tree T is represented in the positive form using only U and I operations
and negation of leaf nodes.  This conversion can be easily done using the
following transformations:

    !( x U y ) = !x I !y
    !( x I y ) = !x U !y
       x - y   =  x I !y

The above transformations are applied to the tree in a pre-order traversal, and
thus all complements are propagated to the leaf nodes. The reverse conversion
to general form can be performed using a post- order traversal (in this case
all negations are first removed from the children of each node).

CSG Minimizing Tree Height
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reduce the traversal state size we desire a well-balanced CSG tree. Our next
optimization stage is aimed to address this problem by minimizing the height of
CSG tree using local transformations. At this stage, two types of treelets are
considered. For brevity, let us call the child node with a greater height (in
the whole tree T) the heavy child. The first type is formed of treelets which
have the same Boolean operation (U or I) in root node N1 and its heavy child N2
(see Figure 5a). 

::
       
          (N1)     
          U    (N2) 
       T1     U  
            T2 T3*     <-- T3* is heavy child of the node N2
                         
   
Swap treelets T1 and T3::

          (N1)     
          U    (N2)          
       T3     U  
            T2 T1* 

If h(T3) > h(T1) + 1 it is beneficial to transpose these subtrees
As with the rotations for binary search trees these result in elevating subtree T3 and demoting subtree T1. 
Thus, the height of the treelet, rooted at N1, is decreased by one.

We use the multi-pass scheme, where at each pass a CSG tree is traversed in
post-order, and appropriate restructuring patterns are applied.

Boolean sum of products
--------------------------

* https://www.dyclassroom.com/boolean-algebra/sum-of-products-and-product-of-sums

There are two forms of canonical expression.

Sum of Products (SOP)
Product of Sums (POS)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_normal_form

Minterms 
      For a boolean function of n variables a product term in which each of the n variables appears once 
      (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a minterm. 
      Thus, a minterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator 
      and the conjunction operator (AND, INTERSECT)

      Minterms are called products because they are the logical AND of a set of variables, 
      3 of the 8 possible minterms for a boolean function of three variables:
 
      * abc
      * a'bc 
      * ab'c   (a AND b AND NOT-c)

maxterms 
      are called sums because they are the logical OR of a set of variables. 

      For a boolean function of n variables a *sum* term in which each of the n variables appears once 
      (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a maxterm. 
      Thus, a maxterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the 
      disjunction operator (OR, UNION).  

      Maxterms are a dual of the minterm idea (i.e., exhibiting a complementary symmetry in all respects). 
      Instead of using ANDs and complements, we use ORs and complements and proceed similarly.

      For example, the following are two of the eight maxterms of three variables:

      * a + b' + c
      * a' + b + c




These concepts are dual because of their complementary-symmetry relationship as expressed by De Morgan's laws.

The term "Sum of Products" or "SoP" is widely used for the canonical form that
is a disjunction (OR, UNION) of minterms (AND, INTERSECT). 

Its De Morgan dual is a "Product of Sums" or "PoS" for the canonical 
form that is a conjunction (AND, INTERSECT) of maxterms (OR, UNION). 

These forms can be useful for the simplification of these functions, which is of
great importance in the optimization of Boolean formulas in general and digital
circuits in particular.

A CSG tree is defined as an inverted ordered binary tree whose leaf nodes are 
primitives and interior nodes are regularized set operations. 

The creation of a balanced, unbalanced, or a perfect CSG tree depends solely on the user and how 
he/she decomposes a solid into its primitives. 

The general rule to create balanced trees is to start to build the model from an  
almost central position and branch out in two opposite directions or vice versa. 

Another useful rule is that symmetric objects can lead to perfect trees 
if they are decomposed properly. 
Figure 9 shows a perfect CSG tree and Figure 10 shows an umbalance CSG tree.

Experience with closed/open geometry
--------------------------------------

Some primitives such as CSG_CYLINDER and CSG_ZSPHERE have 
flags that control endcaps. Disabling caps yields primitives
with open geometry, having a bare boundary.  
Raytracing these allows you to see the "inside" surface of 
the primitive from "outside", which will appear very dark
as normals point outwards from the outer surface.

Such open geometry is however little more than a curiosity.

Open geometry does not have a well defined  "inside" and "outside", which 
means that attempting to use than as CSG sub-objects will 
yield bizarre results, typically with geometry that changes shape 
on moving viewpoint and that you see through to whats behind.

Constructive **SOLID** Geometry only works with solids 
which are by definition closed, with a boolean notion of whether 
a point is inside or outside.

Similarly the Opticks use of indices attached to boundaries 
that identify (outer material, outer surface, inner surface, inner material) 
requires closed geometry.  Without closed geometry optical photon properties
will adopt those of different materials depending on their direction, you 
will see unphysical things like some photons going faster than nearby others.

Regarding geometry modelling and whether it is OK to have open sub-objects 
that are combined in boolean combination : the answer is NO.  
Sub-objects MUST BE CLOSED AND BOUNDED for the CSG implementation to work. 

There is no need to be concerned with "internal" surfaces between sub-objects, 
boolean combination takes care of that. In fact it is best not to think of 
the sub-objects as being distinct objects at all, they are just a convenient way 
to describe combination solids. Only the combination solids have boundary indices
assigned to them.

Am envisaging very small per-solid CSG trees so no need to 
get into parallel thinking complexity.

Binary tree in array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap

Let n be the number of elements in the heap and i be an arbitrary valid index
of the array storing the heap. 

If the tree root is at index 0, with valid indices 0 through n âˆ’ 1, 
then each element a at index i has children 
at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2 its parent at index floor((i âˆ’ 1) âˆ• 2).

::

    // i: 0..n-1
    //  2i+1,2i+2, floor((i âˆ’ 1) âˆ• 2)

    0
    1        2
    3   4    5     6
    7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 
    
    // hmm storing multiple trees in one array requires offsets
    // after the 1st 


Alternatively, if the tree root is at index 1, with valid indices 1 through n, 
then each element a at index i has children 
at indices 2i and 2i +1 its parent at index floor(i âˆ• 2).

::

     // i: 1..n
     // 2i, 2i+1, floor(i âˆ• 2)

     1                            <-- 1
     2           3                <-- 2
     4    5      6       7        <-- 4
     8 9  10 11  12 13   14 15    <-- 8  basis shapes


* NB no need for left/right pointers, 
  because the tree is complete can navigate just from the index, which is an input


CSG tree into (n,4,4) buffer ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nodes need a flag distinguishing shape(leaf-node) from operations(op-node with boolean operation and possibly transform)

**shape-node** (dont call this primitive, reserving that word for OptiX primitives) 
 
* basis shape codes sphere/box/... (4 bits probably enough) 
* basis shape parameters 
* bbox 3*2  COULD SKIP as should be calculable from the shape parameters, but
  is convenient and have sufficient space 

**operation-node**

* operation-code union/intersection/difference (2 bits)
* transform applicability none/left/right/both (2 bits)
* 4x4 transform matrix ? 

The flags can easily fit into the spare (always: 0,0,0,1 ) space in 4x4.


test input of the tree in tboolean ? GGeoTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* start by adding transform handling 


Extra slicing operation ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* shape slicing ? ie restrict intersections to a range along an axis
* can be parameterized very compactly : 2bits for axis and 2 floats for range


Concatenating multiple csg trees into one buffer ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* can extend current prim/part model to hold primitves
  that are lists of parts together with primitives that
  are trees of parts combined by csg operations

::
     (n,1,4)  uint4 primBuffer 
     (n,4,4) float4 partBuffer

    1184 RT_PROGRAM void bounds (int primIdx, float result[6])
    1185 {

    1187   // its a handy place to dump things checking GPU side state
    1188   //rtPrintf("bounds %d \n", primIdx );

    1192   unsigned numParts    = prim.y ;
    1193   unsigned primFlags   = prim.w ;



When/how to use the transforms ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember the user of the CSG tree is the intersect_csg 
code which looks up shape type, parameters, and transforms from it.
Presumably intersect with inverse transformed ray, as thats 
much simpler than transforming the shape.

* care with normal transforms needed if allow 
  transforms like sphere to ellipsoid

Hmm there could be multiple levels of transform up the tree.
So for a node need to look up thru the ancestors with (i-1)/2 
to collect transform matrices to multiply.

::

    int p = (i-1)/2 ; // parent of current node
    while p >= 0:
        // collect transforms
        p = (p-1)/2

Hmm probably doing both rotation and translation within a CSG solid
is rare, could split the operations to slim down nodes.

docs
~~~~~

* http://evanw.github.io/csg.js/docs/

All CSG operations are implemented in terms of two functions, clipTo() and
invert(), which remove parts of a BSP tree inside another BSP tree and swap
solid and empty space, respectively. To find the union of a and b, we want to
remove everything in a inside b and everything in b inside a, then combine
polygons from a and b into one solid::

    a.clipTo(b);
    b.clipTo(a);
    a.build(b.allPolygons());


The only tricky part is handling overlapping coplanar polygons in both trees.
The code above keeps both copies, but we need to keep them in one tree and
remove them in the other tree. To remove them from b we can clip the inverse of
b against a. The code for union now looks like this:

::

    a.clipTo(b);
    b.clipTo(a);
    b.invert();
    b.clipTo(a);
    b.invert();
    a.build(b.allPolygons());

Subtraction and intersection naturally follow from set operations. 
If union is A | B, subtraction is A - B = ~(~A | B) 
and intersection is A & B = ~(~A | ~B) where ~ is the complement operator.

Question : can basis shapes be concave ? what about torii ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Kensler statement:

   sub-objects must be closed, non-self-intersecting 
   and have consistently oriented normals

Intuitive guess is that concave is OK and torii too but such shapes
will need to allow more loops over additional intersections, 
and the intersect algorithms would need to return all roots 
eventually as are repeatedly called with larger tmin.

Implementing the below in an intersect_boolean_solid program
similar to those in oxrap/cu/hemi-pmt.cu seems most appropriate.

The only sticky part is advancing tmin and re-intersecting, this
probably means have to defer the rt*Intersection 
calls to a higher level, meaning will need to pass normals
identity and t values around. 

* hmm dont want to duplicate intersect code, one version having 
  the rt*Intersection calls and the other not though ?
   
* perhaps templating trickery can do this

* hmm probably a higher level macro that conditionally 
  uses the rtPotentialIntersection rtReportIntersection
  functions based on a preprocessor switch can allow
  the same base shape intersection code to be 
  used as part of a boolean and as simple shape

TODO: refactor hemi-pmt.cu into imp headers for each shape

How to map the above described algorithm to OptiX ?
-----------------------------------------------------


rtTrace ?
~~~~~~~~~~

rtTrace can only be called from generate, closest_hit or miss progs
and its too high level anyhow (it needs to take the geometry node instance
as argument : usually top) ... so it is not appropriate for IntersectWithA 


Selector
~~~~~~~~~~

A selector is similar to a group in that it is a collection of higher level
graph nodes. The number of nodes in the collection is set by
rtSelectorSetChildCount, and the individual children are assigned with
rtSelectorSetChild. Valid child types are rtGroup, rtGeometryGroup,
rtTransform, and rtSelector.  The main difference between selectors and groups
is that selectors do not have an acceleration structure associated with them.
Instead, a visit program is specified with rtSelectorSetVisitProgram. This
program is executed every time a ray encounters the selector node during graph
traversal. The program specifies which children the ray should continue
traversal through by calling rtIntersectChild.  A typical use case for a
selector is dynamic (i.e. per-ray) level of detail: an object in the scene may
be represented by a number of geometry nodes, each containing a different level
of detail version of the object. The geometry groups containing these different
representations can be assigned as children of a selector. The visit program
can select which child to intersect using any criterion (e.g. based on the
footprint or length of the current ray), and ignore the others.  As for groups
and other graph nodes, child nodes of a selector can be shared with other graph
nodes to allow flexible instancing.


Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ray traversal invokes an intersection program when the current ray encounters
one of a Geometry objectâ€™s primitives. It is the responsibility of an
intersection program to compute whether the ray intersects with the primitive,
and to report the parametric t-value of the intersection. Additionally, the
intersection program is responsible for computing and reporting any details of
the intersection, such as surface normal vectors, through attribute variables.
Once the intersection program has determined the t-value of a ray-primitive
intersection, it must report the result by calling a pair of OptiX functions,
rtPotentialIntersection and rtReportIntersection.

::

    ï¿¼__device__ bool rtPotentialIntersection( float tmin )
    ï¿¼__device__ bool rtReportIntersection( unsigned int material )


rtPotentialIntersection 
    takes the intersectionâ€™s t-value as an argument. 
    If the t-value could potentially be the closest intersection of the current traversal 
    the function narrows the t-interval of the current ray accordingly and returns true. 
    If the t-value lies outside the t-interval the function returns false, 
    whereupon the intersection program may trivially return.

    If rtPotentialIntersection returns true, 
    the intersection program may then set any attribute variable values 
    and call rtReportIntersection. This function takes an unsigned int specifying 
    the index of a material that must be associated with an any hit and closest hit program. 
    This material index can be used to support primitives of several different 
    materials flattened into a single Geometry object. 
    Traversal then immediately invokes the corresponding any hit program. 
    Should that any hit program invalidate the intersection via the rtIgnoreIntersection function, 
    then rtReportIntersection will return false. Otherwise, it will return true.



current partitioned intersect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This assumes the primitive is chopped into single basis shape subparts.

Loops over all the sub-parts of the primitive invoking 
rtPotentialIntersection/rtReportIntersection multiple times... 
leaving the task narrowing down to find the closest intersect tmin to OptiX

    1256   {
    1257       unsigned int partIdx = solid.x + p ;

sphere/box intersection, nljones:

Your ray payload needs to contain a bit that indicates whether the ray is in a
sphere. Set it to one upon entering the sphere and zero upon leaving. 

## sign(N.D) determines if entering/leaving the shape

Your closest hit program for the sphere sends a new ray in the same direction with
this bit set. Your closest hit program for the box sends a new ray in the same
direction if the bit is one and sets the color of the ray payload if the bit is
zero.

In order to render the interface between the box and shere where they touch,
you also need to keep a bit indicating whether the ray is inside the box.


Example code for CSG in OptiX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/967816/?comment=4985663

dlacewell:

.. haven't thought about this too much, but for a limited number of closed
shapes, you could use per ray data (PRD) to store a hit counter, or really just
a flag, for each shape. 

## bitfield in per-ray-data with 1 or 2 bits for each basis shape could handle
## boolean operations involving small numbers of shapes (as is usual in G4 geometries)  

Use the closest hit program to either terminate the ray
and shade, or toggle the hit flag in PRD for the current shape and continue the
ray using rtTrace. 
Terminate when all hit flags are toggled on at once, meaning
that the current point is inside all the shapes.

##  rtTerminateRay only available in AnyHit, so by this dlacewell presumably means 
##  that can either accept a closest hit when per-ray-data flags are as they should
##  be for the boolean expression being evaluated OR if not (when this is not a real surface)
##  can call rtTrace again (from a modified starting position ? or tmin ) 

For some shapes, you could use the geometric normals to determine whether the
ray is entering or exiting, and then you might not need hit flags.

It may also be possible to do this with an any-hit program for a very small
number of shapes, by storing all intersections for the ray and sorting/shading
them in the ray gen program. That would be slow if there were too many shapes.


You could take optixSpherePP in the SDK and make some changes:

* add another sphere to the scene, that uses the same material
* add a geometry id variable to the sphere, and expose it as an attribute for the closest hit program
* change the closest hit program to make one of the spheres completely 
  transparent based on id, and continue the ray with rtTrace. 
* Make the spheres semi-transparent. You still shoot a new ray with rtTrace, 
  but composite the result with the current sphere color and opacity using per ray data.

Once you get that all working, then it's probably not a big jump to CSG.

B-rep algorithms: 

#. If A and B are the boundaries of two objects whose union, difference or
   intersection we would like to compute, find the intersection of A and B, thus
   dividing each surface into two components, one inside and one outside the other
   surface. 

#. Select the appropriate component of each surface, and 

#. stitch these together to form the correct output. 

This apparent simplicity belies the large number of special cases 
that result from the various ways the two objects can align

BSP trees afford an alternative to B-rep algorithms that avoid their
concomitant case explosion by explicitly handling all degenerate
configurations of geometry. 

One author of Fast, Exact, Linear Booleans has a project named "cork" on github
that implements mesh-based CSG: github.com/gilbo/cork. His site
gilbertbernstein.com/project_boolean.html indicates that this is not the same
method as that of the paper.
