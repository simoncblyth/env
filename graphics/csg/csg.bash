implements CSG operations on meshes elegantly and concisely using BSP trees,
and is meant to serve as an easily understandable implementation of the
algorithm.

All CSG operations are implemented in terms of two functions, clipTo() and
invert(), which remove parts of a BSP tree inside another BSP tree and swap
solid and empty space, respectively. To find the union of a and b, we want to
remove everything in a inside b and everything in b inside a, then combine
polygons from a and b into one solid::

    a.clipTo(b);
    b.clipTo(a);
    a.build(b.allPolygons());


The only tricky part is handling overlapping coplanar polygons in both trees.
The code above keeps both copies, but we need to keep them in one tree and
remove them in the other tree. To remove them from b we can clip the inverse of
b against a. The code for union now looks like this:

::

    a.clipTo(b);
    b.clipTo(a);
    b.invert();
    b.clipTo(a);
    b.invert();
    a.build(b.allPolygons());

Subtraction and intersection naturally follow from set operations. 
If union is A | B, subtraction is A - B = ~(~A | B) 
and intersection is A & B = ~(~A | ~B) where ~ is the complement operator.

Implementing the below in an intersect_boolean_solid program
similar to those in oxrap/cu/hemi-pmt.cu seems most appropriate.

The only sticky part is advancing tmin and re-intersecting, this
probably means have to defer the rt*Intersection 
calls to a higher level, meaning will need to pass normals
identity and t values around. 

* hmm dont want to duplicate intersect code, one version having 
  the rt*Intersection calls and the other not though ?
   
* perhaps templating trickery can do this

* hmm probably a higher level macro that conditionally 
  uses the rtPotentialIntersection rtReportIntersection
  functions based on a preprocessor switch can allow
  the same base shape intersection code to be 
  used as part of a boolean and as simple shape

How to map the above described algorithm to OptiX ?
-----------------------------------------------------


rtTrace ?
~~~~~~~~~~

rtTrace can only be called from generate, closest_hit or miss progs
and its too high level anyhow (it needs to take the geometry node instance
as argument : usually top) ... so it is not appropriate for IntersectWithA 


Selector
~~~~~~~~~~

A selector is similar to a group in that it is a collection of higher level
graph nodes. The number of nodes in the collection is set by
rtSelectorSetChildCount, and the individual children are assigned with
rtSelectorSetChild. Valid child types are rtGroup, rtGeometryGroup,
rtTransform, and rtSelector.  The main difference between selectors and groups
is that selectors do not have an acceleration structure associated with them.
Instead, a visit program is specified with rtSelectorSetVisitProgram. This
program is executed every time a ray encounters the selector node during graph
traversal. The program specifies which children the ray should continue
traversal through by calling rtIntersectChild.  A typical use case for a
selector is dynamic (i.e. per-ray) level of detail: an object in the scene may
be represented by a number of geometry nodes, each containing a different level
of detail version of the object. The geometry groups containing these different
representations can be assigned as children of a selector. The visit program
can select which child to intersect using any criterion (e.g. based on the
footprint or length of the current ray), and ignore the others.  As for groups
and other graph nodes, child nodes of a selector can be shared with other graph
nodes to allow flexible instancing.


Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ray traversal invokes an intersection program when the current ray encounters
one of a Geometry objectâ€™s primitives. It is the responsibility of an
intersection program to compute whether the ray intersects with the primitive,
and to report the parametric t-value of the intersection. Additionally, the
intersection program is responsible for computing and reporting any details of
the intersection, such as surface normal vectors, through attribute variables.
Once the intersection program has determined the t-value of a ray-primitive
intersection, it must report the result by calling a pair of OptiX functions,
rtPotentialIntersection and rtReportIntersection.

::

    ï¿¼__device__ bool rtPotentialIntersection( float tmin )
    ï¿¼__device__ bool rtReportIntersection( unsigned int material )


rtPotentialIntersection 
    takes the intersectionâ€™s t-value as an argument. 
    If the t-value could potentially be the closest intersection of the current traversal 
    the function narrows the t-interval of the current ray accordingly and returns true. 
    If the t-value lies outside the t-interval the function returns false, 
    whereupon the intersection program may trivially return.

    If rtPotentialIntersection returns true, 
    the intersection program may then set any attribute variable values 
    and call rtReportIntersection. This function takes an unsigned int specifying 
    the index of a material that must be associated with an any hit and closest hit program. 
    This material index can be used to support primitives of several different 
    materials flattened into a single Geometry object. 
    Traversal then immediately invokes the corresponding any hit program. 
    Should that any hit program invalidate the intersection via the rtIgnoreIntersection function, 
    then rtReportIntersection will return false. Otherwise, it will return true.



current partitioned intersect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This assumes the primitive is chopped into single basis shape subparts.

Loops over all the sub-parts of the primitive invoking 
rtPotentialIntersection/rtReportIntersection multiple times... 
leaving the task narrowing down to find the closest intersect tmin to OptiX

    1256   {
    1257       unsigned int partIdx = solid.x + p ;

sphere/box intersection, nljones:

Your ray payload needs to contain a bit that indicates whether the ray is in a
sphere. Set it to one upon entering the sphere and zero upon leaving. 

## sign(N.D) determines if entering/leaving the shape

Your closest hit program for the sphere sends a new ray in the same direction with
this bit set. Your closest hit program for the box sends a new ray in the same
direction if the bit is one and sets the color of the ray payload if the bit is
zero.

In order to render the interface between the box and shere where they touch,
you also need to keep a bit indicating whether the ray is inside the box.


Example code for CSG in OptiX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/967816/?comment=4985663

dlacewell:

.. haven't thought about this too much, but for a limited number of closed
shapes, you could use per ray data (PRD) to store a hit counter, or really just
a flag, for each shape. 

## bitfield in per-ray-data with 1 or 2 bits for each basis shape could handle
## boolean operations involving small numbers of shapes (as is usual in G4 geometries)  

Use the closest hit program to either terminate the ray
and shade, or toggle the hit flag in PRD for the current shape and continue the
ray using rtTrace. 
Terminate when all hit flags are toggled on at once, meaning
that the current point is inside all the shapes.

##  rtTerminateRay only available in AnyHit, so by this dlacewell presumably means 
##  that can either accept a closest hit when per-ray-data flags are as they should
##  be for the boolean expression being evaluated OR if not (when this is not a real surface)
##  can call rtTrace again (from a modified starting position ? or tmin ) 

For some shapes, you could use the geometric normals to determine whether the
ray is entering or exiting, and then you might not need hit flags.

It may also be possible to do this with an any-hit program for a very small
number of shapes, by storing all intersections for the ray and sorting/shading
them in the ray gen program. That would be slow if there were too many shapes.


You could take optixSpherePP in the SDK and make some changes:

* add another sphere to the scene, that uses the same material
* add a geometry id variable to the sphere, and expose it as an attribute for the closest hit program
* change the closest hit program to make one of the spheres completely 
  transparent based on id, and continue the ray with rtTrace. 
* Make the spheres semi-transparent. You still shoot a new ray with rtTrace, 
  but composite the result with the current sphere color and opacity using per ray data.

Once you get that all working, then it's probably not a big jump to CSG.

   intersection we would like to compute, find the intersection of A and B, thus
   dividing each surface into two components, one inside and one outside the other
   surface. 

#. Select the appropriate component of each surface, and 

#. stitch these together to form the correct output. 

This apparent simplicity belies the large number of special cases 
that result from the various ways the two objects can align

BSP trees afford an alternative to B-rep algorithms that avoid their
concomitant case explosion by explicitly handling all degenerate
configurations of geometry. 

One author of Fast, Exact, Linear Booleans has a project named "cork" on github
that implements mesh-based CSG: github.com/gilbo/cork. His site
gilbertbernstein.com/project_boolean.html indicates that this is not the same
method as that of the paper.
