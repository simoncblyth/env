On October 22, 2013, Apple released OS X Mavericks, also known as OS X version 10.9. 
This version of the operating system included a long awaited update to the 
supported version of OpenGL. The 6th edition of the OpenGL SuperBible is
about OpenGL version 4.3, and unfortunately, Appleâ€™s latest and greatest only
supports version 4.1 of the API. As OpenGL 4.1 was released on July 26, 2010,
this puts OS X more than three years behind.
