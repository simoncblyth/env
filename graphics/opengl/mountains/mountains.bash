* retina in quad corner problem when press SPACE


Approach
-----------

* http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/10/gpu-based-dynamic-geometry-lod/

Instead of the visibility filtering of instance transforms (like instcull- and nature-)
partition the visible instance transforms into three LOD streams according to distance.  
Thus updating GPU buffers of instance transforms for each LOD level.

Then at render just make three instanced draw calls, to show all visible instances
at their appropriate LOD level.


Occlusion Culling : ie skipping in frustum objects that are obscured by other objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/10/hierarchical-z-map-based-occlusion-culling/

At first, this may sound stupid as you have to draw the object in order to tell
whether it is visible or not. While in this form it really sounds silly, in
practice occlusion query can save a lot of work for the GPU. Think about you
have a complex object with several thousands of triangles
If you would like to determine the visibility of it using occlusion query you
would simply render e.g. the bounding box of the object and if the bounding box
is visible (occlusion query returns that some samples have passed) then it
means the object itself is most probably visible. This way you can save the GPU
from the unnecessary processing of large amount of geometry.

So what we expect from an occlusion culling algorithm is to give one of the
following results: the object is not visible or the object is most probably
visible. The bigger this probability is the better the occlusion culling
effectiveness is.

texture2d -> texture
-----------------------

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26266198/glsl-invalid-call-of-undeclared-identifier-texture2d

Cripes. Finally found the answer right after I posted the question. texture2D has been replaced by texture.

Yes, be aware that on OS X #version 150 can only mean #version 150 core. On
other platforms where compatibility profiles are implemented, you can continue
to use things that were deprecated beginning in GLSL 1.30 such as texture2D if
you write #version 150 compatibility. You really don't want that, but it's
worth mentioning ;) â€“ Andon M. Coleman
